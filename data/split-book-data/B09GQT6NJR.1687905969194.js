And not even Roost, Knives, or Alamander might save him.</p> <p>Is this the end of the road for the ruler of Tine, or will he manage to use his wits and a lifetime of experience to once again escape sure death and the annihilation of his nation?</p> <p>Follow Charles as he returns to the Scale Market to trade with more dragons and curry favor with them. Follow him as he is finally forced to develop his army and start investing money and points into military advancements.</p>";
