window.bookSummaryJSON = "Veteran <i>New York Times</i> economics reporter Edmund L. Andrews was intimately aware of the dangers posed by easy mortgages from fast-buck lenders. But, eager to buy a home and start a new life, he gave in to temptation and began a surreal adventure into the mortgage mayhem that nearly wrecked our economy.<p><i>Busted</i> weaves together the author's own ride to the edge of bankruptcy with the tragicomic stories of his lenders, the Wall Street pros behind them, and the policymakers in Washington who were oblivious until it was too late. The story takes Andrews to the offices of Alan Greenspan, the mansions of subprime-mortgage millionaires in Southern California, a despondent deal makers' convention in Las Vegas, and Wall Street. </p><p>Rich with on-the-ground reporting, <i>Busted</i> is a darkly humorous exploration of the cynicism and self-destructive judgment that led to America's biggest economic calamity in generations.</p>";
