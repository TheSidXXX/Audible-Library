window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A \"suspenseful, atmospheric tale...punctured by a gut-punch twist\" (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>), <i>A Boy and His Dog at the End of the World</i> is a story of survival, courage, and hope amid the ruins of our world.</p> <p>My name's Griz. I've never been to school, I've never had friends, and in my whole life I've not met enough people to play a game of football. My parents told me how crowded the world used to be, before all the people went away. But we were never lonely on our remote island. We had each other and our dogs.</p> <p>Then the thief came.</p> <p>\"This unputdownable story has everything - a well-imagined post-apocalyptic world, great characters, incredible suspense, and, of course, the fierce love of some very good dogs.\" (<i>Kirkus</i>, starred review)&nbsp;</p>";
