window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Stranded on an alien planet with his consciousness implanted inside of a Station Core, Milton Frederick has used all of the resources at his disposal to protect his damaged Core from local hostile beasts, Proctans, and even a massive bear-gorilla hybrid that almost single-handedly destroyed his dungeon.&nbsp;</p> <p>Milton is joined by his AI guide, ALANNA, as well as Brint and Whisp - two Proctans that have joined him in his endeavors; with the introduction of two new “recruits” - Rosewyn and Moxwell - they form a plan that enlists a few more Guardian Guild members to help combat the threat that Brint had discovered underneath the Quizard Mountains to the east.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, not everything is going as well for the Guardian Guild, the organization tasked with defending the Proctan kingdom from the wild beasts roaming their borders. A political coup instigated by the Cordpower Company has upset the monarchial government and the Guild has been caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, Milton has to figure out how to deal with that issue, while at the same time preparing for the inevitable arrival of the threat from the Quizard Mountains.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fortunately, new discoveries of his own has led to great strides in manipulating the Gene Mutations that affect the Proctans. Not only has the introduction of a Neurological Control Unit allowed for the manipulation of abilities, but it also provides something that will change the very nature of how the Proctans view death - and something that Milton, as a gamer, knows very well: respawning.&nbsp;</p> <p>But will those advantages be enough against the threat coming their way?&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains LitRPG/GameLit elements such as level progression and experience, optional tables, no harems, and a heavy Dungeon Core emphasis.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
