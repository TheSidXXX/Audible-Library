Their new Virtual Reality system is the perfect tool to train soldiers for the coming war. There is a shortage of enlisted men and women that possess the \"talent\".

Unknown to him, the Game Developers have no time to waste. With the pain dampeners turned off and an army ready to attack the new players as they enter Codename: Freedom, he will have to ask himself an unexpected question. Is his dream worth suffering for? Will he quit, go mad, or find the motivation to fight when it becomes painfully clear that this is far from just another game? </p>";
