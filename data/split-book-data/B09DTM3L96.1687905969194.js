Venezuelans use Gary’s property for drug deals. Legendary dadaist Claude Balls stuns the world with his creations. Leotis, a giant Mekong catfish, becomes Gary’s friend and advisor, but only Gary can see the painfully shy Leotis - perhaps it was that cane toad Gary licked. Krystal trains to fight Lucha Libre sensation Javelina.</p>";
