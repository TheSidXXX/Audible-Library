window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Looking for an escape from reality? Then look no further!</p> <p><i>Escape from Virtual Island</i> is an epic comedy adventure starring Paul Rudd, written by John Lutz of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, <i>Late Night with Seth Meyers</i>, and <i>30 Rock</i>, and produced by Broadway Video.</p> <p>Rounding out the ensemble cast in this genre-hopping, madcap comedy are Emmy nominee Jack McBrayer, <i>Wine Country</i> and <i>AP Bio</i>’s Paula Pell, <i>Late Night with Seth Meyers</i>’ Amber Ruffin, and <i>30 Rock</i>’s Scott Adsit.</p> <p>The Audible Original also features the voice talents of Jason Sudeikis, Jane Krakowski, Olivia Wilde, Kenan Thompson, Seth Meyers, Rachel Dratch, Henry Winkler, and a host of other comedy favorites.</p> <p>About the story:</p> <p>In the year 2038, there’s only one destination that can play host to the world’s wealthiest adventure seekers: the Pengalaman Island Resort and Virtual Reality Theme Park. Located on a private South Pacific island, guests here live out their wildest fantasies in custom-made virtual reality simulations while also enjoying the usual amenities of an exclusive five-star getaway.</p> <p>All is relatively breezy until famed billionaire and avid guest, Mr. Wagner (Sudeikis), goes missing within a virtual simulation. His only hope? A daring rescue led by Derek Ambrose (Rudd), the maladjusted heir to his mother’s resort empire, and his ragtag search party consisting of Faith (Ruffin), a tech-nerd extraordinaire (and naturally, his ex); Ramona Kurtz (Pell), the foul-mouthed head of island security; and Beasley (McBrayer), the resort’s lead concierge and Ambrose family confidant.</p> <p>What ensues is a high-octane, comedy throwback filled with memorable performances throughout, and a reminder that real life can be the ultimate experience if you’re just willing to open your heart and dive in headfirst.</p> <p><b>Please note: This content is not for kids. It is for mature audiences only. This audio comedy features adult language, sexual content, and virtually every innuendo you can literally imagine. Discretion is advised.</b></p>";
