window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Humanity is fractured. The world is burning. Ravenous Orakh have arrived.</b></p> <p>Dan Thrush has the capability, technology, and magic to stitch society back together - and add a bottleneck for the invasion. Unfortunately, not everyone wants things to resolve quickly. Even as he tries to clean up the mess that spawned in the wake of the Elven invasion, some people challenge him for control of the new world; isolated pockets of humanity fight the aliens, and others have decided to quietly give up.</p> <p>Giving up is a bad idea: Orakh are hunting the survivors like animals, and they aren’t exactly known for taking live prisoners. Though reluctant to trust anyone but his closest allies, Dan will need to jury-rig a force that can beat back the swarm: a combination of new magic, weapons, and fair-weather allies. This isn’t the first time he’s faced these odds, but it is the first time he’s been around long enough to have bitter enemies who want to see him fail.</p> <p>Sometimes the teeth coming at his throat are the only thing reminding Dan of the price for failure.</p>";
