window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Hobbit</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>Moneyball</i></b><b> in this definitive book on </b><b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i></b><b> - from its origins and rise to cultural prominence to the continued effects on popular culture today. </b></p> <p><b>Here, There Be Dragons.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ancient red dragons with 527 hit points, +44 to attack, and a 20d10 breath weapon, to be specific. In the world of fantasy role-playing, those numbers describe a winged serpent with immense strength and the ability to spit fire. There are few beasts more powerful - just like there are few games more important than <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even if you’ve never played <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>, you probably know someone who has: the game has had a profound influence on our culture. Released in 1974 - decades before the Internet and social media - <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> inspired one of the original nerd subcultures, and is still revered by millions of fans around the world. Now the authoritative history and magic of the game are revealed by an award-winning journalist and lifelong <i>D&amp;D</i> player.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Of Dice and Men,</i> David Ewalt recounts the development of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> from the game’s roots on the battlefields of ancient Europe, through the hysteria that linked it to satanic rituals and teen suicides, to its apotheosis as father of the modern video-game industry. As he chronicles the surprising history of the game’s origins (a history largely unknown even to hardcore players) and examines <i>D&amp;D</i>’s profound impact, Ewalt weaves laser-sharp subculture analysis with his own present-day gaming experiences. An enticing blend of history, journalism, narrative, and memoir, <i>Of Dice and Men</i> sheds light on America’s most popular (and widely misunderstood) form of collaborative entertainment.</p>";
