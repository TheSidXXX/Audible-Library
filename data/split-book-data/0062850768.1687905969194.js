window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Peter V. Brett returns to his groundbreaking Demon Cycle series with this enthralling novella - the latest story set in his much-loved fantasy world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Each night, the world is overrun by bloodthirsty demons. For centuries, humanity survived only by hiding behind defensive wards - magical symbols with the power to repel the demons. Now, the rediscovery of long-forgotten combat wards has given them the magic they need to fight back.</p> <p>In Tibbet’s Brook, the fighting wards have brought change, but the factions and grudges of a troubled past remain. Selia Square, the woman they call Barren, has long been the force that holds the Brook together. As a terrifying new threat emerges, she rallies her people once again.</p> <p>But Selia has a past of her own. And in a small community, the personal and the political can never be divided. If Tibbet’s Brook is to survive, Selia must uncover memories she has buried deep - the woman she once was, the woman she once loved - and retell their story.</p>";
