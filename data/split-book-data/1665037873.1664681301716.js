Keep her from bringing more humans close to our land. But before I even met her, I caught her scent. The moon’s full, and I had to follow it. I couldn’t stop myself. I ran straight into human territory, onto her property.&nbsp;</p> <p>Found her bathing naked in the moonlight and showed her my wolf. Now all bets are off. My alpha may want her gone, but I need her to stay. In fact, I’ll do anything to make sure she never, ever leaves.</p>";
