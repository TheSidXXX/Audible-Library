For once.</p> <p>After a player-led event turns his once peaceful town into a band of ravenous monsters, Hirrus obtains a sentience usually unobtainable by non-player characters. It might be a gift of the gods or a mistake, but Hirrus doesn’t care. It means he can track down and find the players responsible and stop them from doing it again.</p> <p>Thing is, players don’t like their plans being interrupted. And in this game, there’s no resurrection until the weekly reset. Will Hirrus be able to cut a path of destruction across the land to get his revenge, or will the players be able to overwhelm him and bring him to justice?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Experience the start of a new EvP LitRPG series about a warrior's quest for revenge against cruel players. </b></p>";
