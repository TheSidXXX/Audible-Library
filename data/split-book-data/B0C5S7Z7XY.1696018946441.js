window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A completely satirical guide to the great corn prairie state of Illinois. What starts off as an idiotic and darkly humorous travel guide slowly devolves into the realm of horror for both the travel guide and his family.&nbsp;</p> <p>During their travels through the cities and parks detailed in the guidebook, they begin to encounter an unknown darkness, absurd and unusual rituals, and a great evil that lurks behind the countless miles of cornfields in Illinois.&nbsp;</p> <p>Learn about Illinois's great (entirely made up) history, visit its grossly inaccurate cities, and learn absolutely nothing about its many wonderful parks. A work of very dark comedy, this will provide you with absolutely no useful information about Illinois. Have a great trip!</p>";
