window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Pack rule number three: The alpha must mate.</b></p> <p>The stronger the alpha, the greater the danger. Moon madness could claim me any time now. I’ve looked all over the continent, gone to mating games, but I still haven’t found the she-wolf meant to be mine. I’ve already become too feral in bed. I’m not safe - not for random females. Especially not the one who just moved into the ranch next door. She’s way too tempting. And I’m way too dangerous. I have to stay away. I don’t dare get near her. Because I would die before I ever let anything harm the little human. Including me.</p>";
