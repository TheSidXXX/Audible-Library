window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Deadpool</i> meets <i>Game of Thrones</i> in this thrilling tale of demons, dragons and treachery.&nbsp;</p> <p>After Breed, a thief-assassin of small renown, is chased by a dragon, tricked by a demon, almost killed by a psychopathic gang boss and hunted by a ferocious spider, life really takes a turn for the worse. Sentenced to five years bonded servitude to a one-handed priest magician, Breed must find the hammer of the ancient hero known only as The Hammer of the North within a year and a day...or else. So, with only a drug-addicted vagrant, a rat-faced child and a timid priest for backup, Breed sets out for the mighty city of Valen and the tomb of the Hammer. What could possibly go wrong?&nbsp;</p> <p>Grim, dark and funny, <i>Dangerous to Know</i> is the first audiobook in the epic sword and sorcery trilogy The Chronicles of Breed.</p> <p>When it was first published in 2014, this story was short-listed for the Robert Holdstock, British Fantasy Society, Best Novel Award.</p>";
