window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From <i>New York Times</i> best seller Corinne Michaels comes a sexy new standalone romance novel.</b> </p> <p>I'm not a one-night stand kind of woman. I'm especially not the woman who has a few drinks at a concert and ends up in bed with my childhood celebrity crush, Eli Walsh. </p> <p>However, that's exactly where I find myself. </p> <p>What's a girl to do after a drunken mistake? Run. I grab my clothes and get away from the powerful, irresistible, and best-sex-of-my-life superstar as fast as I can. His gorgeous green eyes, rock-hard body, and cocky smile have no place in my world. My life is complicated enough. </p> <p>Someone forgot to tell him that. </p> <p>Eli is relentless. Pushing his way into my heart, wearing me down, proving he's nothing like I assumed, and everything I need. But when my world shatters to pieces, he holds the broken bits together. Unwillingly, I fall desperately in love with him. </p> <p>He made me think we'd have forever...I should've listened when he said we could only own tonight. </p>";
