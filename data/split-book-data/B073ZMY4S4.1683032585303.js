Do they have enough people? Can they get the right people to help? </p> <p>John's cousin is now part of the team. Will she make it? </p> <p>There is a group looking to find them and they are using Barb to do it. </p> <p>This is the first book in the second arc (books 8-14) for The Kurtherian Gambit. The stakes are raised a lot higher! </p> <p>Please note: There is flagrantly foul language in this novel. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing. </p> <p>If you haven't listened to the previous books, you will need to go back to number one (the book does not explain the characters and previous relationships/deeds). </p>";
