Then humanity's great empire fell, and the program's decisions were lost to time.</p> <p>Aeons later, humanity and its new spider allies detected fragmentary radio signals between the stars. They dispatched an exploration vessel, hoping to find cousins from old Earth.</p> <p>But those ancient terraformers woke something on Nod better left undisturbed.</p> <p>And it's been waiting for them.</p> <p>For more from Adrian Tchaikovsky, check out:<br> <i>Children of Time</i></p>";
