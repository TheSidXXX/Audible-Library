window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"You owe it to yourself to experience this audio odyssey birthed in the fertile mind of Stan Lee as he propels the listener into a digital sidereal of past, present and future.” (Roy Thomas)</p> <p><b>A brand-new audio event set in the Audible and </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling Alliances universe of legendary creator Stan Lee, performed by fan favorite Wil Wheaton.</b></p> <p>Biohacker Olivia Park is obsessed with an emerging mystery within Oz, the online portal created by alien technology. What she finds is a primitive xenobot, Eno, who takes her on a mind-bending trip through time that begins as the Berlin Wall is falling, and takes her back to the origins of the modern internet and the fall of a digital Atlantis created by her father, Wesley Park, and entrepreneur William Ackerson.</p> <p><i>A New Reality</i> expands Stan Lee’s final science fiction universe in new and unexpected ways, exploring the early global computing boom of the 1990s through the eyes of two well-meaning visionaries whose innovations introduce the world to the promise, power, and perils of connectivity - and whose original sins could destroy it all.&nbsp;</p>";
