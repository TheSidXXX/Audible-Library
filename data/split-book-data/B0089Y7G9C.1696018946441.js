window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Published to coincide with the release of Academy Award-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone's major film of <i>Savages</i> from Universal Pictures in July 2012 - starring John Travolta, Blake Lively, Benecio Del Toro, Uma Thurman, Emile Hirsch, Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Johnson, and Salma Hayek - this is the much-anticipated prequel to Don Winslow's acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> best seller. </p> <p>In <i>Savages</i>, Don Winslow introduced Ben and Chon, twentysomething best friends who risk everything to save the girl they both love, O. Among the most celebrated literary thrillers in recent memory, <i>Savages</i> was a Top 10 Book of 2010 selection by Janet Maslin in <i>The </i><i>New York Times </i>and Stephen King in <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> as well as Sarah Weinman in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and publications around the world. </p> <p> Now, in his high-octane prequel, Winslow reaches back in time to tell the story of how Ben, Chon, and O became the people they are. Spanning from 1960s Southern California to the recent past, it is a tale of family in all its forms - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, friends and lovers. As the younger generation does battle with a cabal of drug dealers and crooked cops, they come to learn that their future is inextricably linked with their parents' history. A series of breakneck twists and turns puts the two generations on a collision course, culminating in a stunning showdown that will ultimately force Ben, Chon, and O to choose between their real families and their love for each other.</p>";
