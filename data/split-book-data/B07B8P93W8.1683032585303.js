window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“A deeply researched and morbidly fascinating chronicle of one of America’s most notorious female killers.” - </b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p> <p><b>An Amazon Charts bestseller.</b></p> <p>In the pantheon of serial killers, Belle Gunness stands alone. She was the rarest of female psychopaths, a woman who engaged in wholesale slaughter, partly out of greed but mostly for the sheer joy of it. Between 1902 and 1908, she lured a succession of unsuspecting victims to her Indiana “murder farm\". Some were hired hands. Others were well-to-do bachelors. All of them vanished without a trace. When their bodies were dug up, they hadn’t merely been poisoned, like victims of other female killers. They’d been butchered.</p> <p><i>Hell’s Princess</i> is a riveting account of one of the most sensational killing sprees in the annals of American crime: the shocking series of murders committed by the woman who came to be known as Lady Bluebeard. The only definitive book on this notorious case and the first to reveal previously unknown information about its subject, Harold Schechter’s gripping, suspenseful narrative has all the elements of a classic mystery - and all the gruesome twists of a nightmare.</p>";
