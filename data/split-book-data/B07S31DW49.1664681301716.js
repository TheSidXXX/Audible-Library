Well, necromancers are only human. Jakub Russo has a big heart but a dark past, and when he's banished from the magical academy for failure in his first assignment, he finds himself needing new allies, new spells, and new weapons.</p> <p>A world of secrets and spells awaits outside the academy doors, and Jakub knows that one day, he'll master them all. If he can find his own code, he'll become the best necromancer who ever lived.</p> <p><b>This is Book Two in the Necromancer series. It can be listened to as a standalone, but I recommend starting with Book One, </b><b><i>Path of the Necromancer</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
