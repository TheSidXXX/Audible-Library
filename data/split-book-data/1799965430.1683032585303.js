They didn’t understand how the men who’d been spurred, wrangled, tangled, and even hitched to the other Steele heiresses fell so hard and so fast. Until now. One look at Natalie ruins all other women for Sam and Ashe. But she’s not easy to tame. They’ll need to lasso more than just her heart in order to make her theirs once and for all.&nbsp;</p> <p>But a final twist puts all five of the Steele sisters in danger. With the help of their men, Natalie, Kady, Penny, Cricket, and Sarah must finally find peace and bring the one thing back to the ranch that’s always been missing: family.</p>";
