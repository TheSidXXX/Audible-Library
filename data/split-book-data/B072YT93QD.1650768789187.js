According to legend, those few who reach the top of the tower will be granted a boon by the spire's goddess. </p> <p>He never returned. </p> <p>Now it's Corin's turn. He's headed to the top floor, on a mission to meet the goddess. </p> <p>If he can survive the trials, Corin will earn an attunement, but that won't be sufficient to survive the dangers on the upper levels. For that he's going to need training, allies, and a lot of ingenuity. </p> <p>The journey won't be easy, but Corin won't stop until he gets his brother back. </p>";
