window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the multi-award-winning authors of </b><b><i>A Prince's Errand</i></b><b> comes an enthralling prequel that expands the world of Kalda.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tor’s rebellion against the Mindolarn Empire has delivered a crippling blow - the death of Emperor Mentas. Seeking aid from their allies, the Mindolarn Empire turns to the Principality of Soroth and its society of mages, the Sorothian Magical Order.</p> <p>In an effort to aid the empire, the Order’s council mounts an expedition to travel to the nethermost reaches of the world, the Abodine Wasteland. There they must venture to a reliquary hidden deep within crystal ruins left over from a fabled war now almost forgotten. Inside the reliquary, legend says, lie ancient tevisrals - magical objects - that the Mindolarn Empire can use against the Tor rebellion.&nbsp;</p> <p>Among the adventurers heading to the perilous wastes is Amendal Aramien, a conjurer with a quick wit, a keen mind, and a licentious appetite. Forced into this expedition, Amendal begrudgingly enters the depths of the reliquary. What he unearths will forever change his life and set the stage for the return of a Dark God.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Tales of the Amulet:</b></p> <p>Several millennia ago, a war raged between the factions of dragonkind. With their world ravaged, the Kaldean Alliance forged the Amulet of Draconic Control and the Tethering Stone, and banished their foes to other realms, saving Kalda from utter destruction. Fearing the power of the Amulet, the survivors secreted it away. But now knowledge of the Amulet has resurfaced - and in the wrong hands, war could erupt anew.&nbsp;</p>";
