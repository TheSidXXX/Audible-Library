Sean Truitt was just the first one. </p> <p>Stephen interrupted him, \"You look tired,\" he spoke as he took a seat in one of the two blue chairs facing Barnabas's desk. </p> <p>Barnabas leaned back, keeping the folder open, \"Is she serious?\" He pointed to the document, \"Even ADAM, using our agreed punishment matrix, is calling for this lady to be punished financially.\" He closed the folder, \"She walks the line towards Michael all the time, brother...\" </p> <p>To be continued ... </p> <p>Please note, there is flagrantly foul language in these novels.
