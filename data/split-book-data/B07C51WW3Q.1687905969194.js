Eventually setting out to search for their promised reinforcements, they soon realize that they weren't as alone on the frontier as they thought they were.</p> <p>Just managing to rescue a caravan of settlers in the nick of time from a horde of bandits, Marcus and the rest of Virtus barely have a chance to catch their breath before they find themselves thrust into the middle of Eberian politics, revealing a plot that threatens to not only take away their hard-won independence, but to destroy Aldford completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
