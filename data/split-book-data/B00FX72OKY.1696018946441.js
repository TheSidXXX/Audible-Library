At the scene of the crime, Caleb finds an alluring and clever cliff runner, crazy Mal, who easily outpaces him. </p> <p>But Caleb has more to worry about than the demonvinfestation, Mal, or job security when he discovers that his father - the last priest of the old gods and leader of the True Quechal terrorists - has broken into his home and is wanted in connection with the attacks on the water supply. </p> <p>From the beginning, Caleb and Mal are bound by lust, craft, and chance, as both play a dangerous game where gods and people are pawns. They sleep on water, they dance in fire, and all the while the Twin Serpents slumbering beneath the earth are stirring...and hungry. </p>";
