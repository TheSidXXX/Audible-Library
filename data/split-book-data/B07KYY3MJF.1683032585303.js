window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Available in audio first, an intoxicating new romance by</b><b><i> USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author Louise Bay!</b></p> <p>Being labelled a player never stopped me from being successful with women. Until I met Truly Harbury. Truly was the first girl who ever turned me down. The first female friend I ever had. And she might just be the first woman with whom I ever fall in love.&nbsp;</p> <p>When an emergency means she needs my help running her family’s charity, I’m happy to introduce her to the glitz and glamour of the London business world - taking her to dinners, coaching her through speeches, zipping up the sexy evening gown I helped her pick out. The more time we spend together, the more I want to convince her I’m not a man to avoid, that we’re not as unsuited as she believes.</p> <p>She sees herself as the book-reading, science-loving introvert while I’m the dangerous, outgoing charmer. She thinks I love parties and people whereas she prefers pajamas and takeout. What she doesn’t realize is that I like everything about her - the way her smile lights up a room, how her curves light up my imagination, and especially the way her lips taste when coated with tequila.</p> <p>She’s the first woman with whom I ever fell in love. I just need to know if she could ever love me, too.</p>";
