window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With laugh-out-loud funny parenting observations, the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author and award-winning comedian delivers a book that is perfect for anyone who has ever raised a child, been a child, or refuses to stop acting like one.</b></p> <p>In 2016, comedian Mike Birbiglia and poet Jennifer Hope Stein took their 14-month-old daughter, Oona, to the Nantucket Film Festival. When the festival director picked them up at the airport, she asked Mike if he would perform at the storytelling night. She said, \"The theme of the stories is jealousy.\"</p> <p>Jen quipped, \"You're jealous of Oona. You should talk about that.\"</p> <p>And so Mike began sharing some of his darkest and funniest thoughts about the decision to have a child. Jen and Mike revealed to each other their sides of what had gone down during Jen's pregnancy and that first year with their child. Over the next couple years, these stories evolved into a Broadway show, and the more Mike performed it, the more he heard how it resonated - not just with parents but also people who resist all kinds of change.</p> <p>So he pored over his journals, dug deeper, and created this book: <i>The New One: Painfully True Stories from a Reluctant Dad</i>. Along with hilarious and poignant stories he has never shared before, this audiobook is sprinkled with poetry Jen wrote as she navigated the same rocky shores of new parenthood.</p> <p>So here it is. This book is an experiment - sort of like a family.</p>";
