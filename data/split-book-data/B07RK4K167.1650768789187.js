He breaks the minds of beasts, exerting the steel vise of his will over their own, bending them to his wishes.&nbsp;</p> <p>His ability is severely limited in terms of the types of creatures he can control and how many. Most monsters have always been beyond him.</p> <p>And then one day he accidentally breaks a monster girl. Doors begin to open for him faster than he thought possible.</p> <p>Note: This book contains harem elements. The main character certainly isn't shy around women, and the magic system is unique in ways you might not expect. Also, the story can get a tad dark in places.</p>";
