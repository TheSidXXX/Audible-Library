window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Detective Harry Bosch and his new partner investigate a recent murder where the trigger was pulled nine years earlier.</b> </p> <p>In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime. So when a man succumbs to complications from being shot by a stray bullet nine years earlier, Bosch catches a case in which the body is still fresh, but all other evidence is virtually nonexistent. </p> <p>Now Bosch and rookie Detective Lucia Soto are tasked with solving what turns out to be a highly charged, politically sensitive case. Beginning with the bullet that's been lodged for years in the victim's spine, they must pull new leads from years-old information, which soon reveal that this shooting may have been anything but random. </p> <p>In this gripping new novel, Michael Connelly shows once again why Harry Bosch is \"one of the greats of crime fiction\" (<i>New York Daily News</i>).</p>";
