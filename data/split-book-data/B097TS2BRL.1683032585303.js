But the growing community isn't without dangers....</b></p> <p>Between raiding Red Caps and dives into the local dungeon, danger seems to lurk around every corner. Adventure. It makes Hall wonder if he should remain as Lord of Skara Brae. The excitement of life in the wild calls to him, but so do his responsibilities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both duty and adventure collide when members of the Greencloak Rangers, Hall's favorite faction from the original game, arrive in Skara Brae seeking Leigh's help in her role as Druid Custodian.

Why is Hall encountering signs of Bastion The Sage everywhere?
