window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Own it, snowflakes: you've&nbsp;lost&nbsp;everything you&nbsp;claim to&nbsp;hold dear.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>White&nbsp;</i>is Bret Easton Ellis's first work of nonfiction. Already the&nbsp;bad boy of American literature, from&nbsp;<i>Less Than Zero</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>American Psycho</i>, Ellis has also&nbsp;earned the wrath of right-thinking people everywhere with his provocations on social media, and here he&nbsp;escalates his admonishment of received truths as&nbsp;expressed by today's version of \"the left.\" Eschewing convention, he embraces views that will make many in literary and&nbsp;media communities&nbsp;cringe, as he takes aim at the relentless anti-Trump fixation, coastal elites, corporate&nbsp;censorship, Hollywood, identity politics, Generation Wuss, \"woke\"&nbsp;cultural watchdogs, the obfuscation of ideals&nbsp;once both&nbsp;cherished and clear, and the fugue state of American democracy. In a young century marked by hysterical correctness and obsessive fervency on both sides of an aisle that's taken on the scale of the Grand Canyon,&nbsp;White&nbsp;is a clarion call for freedom of speech and artistic freedom.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"The central tension in Ellis's art - or his life, for that matter - is that while [his] aesthetic is the cool reserve of his native California, detachment over ideology, he can't stop generating heat.... He's hard-wired to break furniture.\" (Karen Heller,&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Washington Post</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Sweating with rage...humming with paranoia.\" (Anna Leszkiewicz,&nbsp;<i>The Guardian</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Snowflakes on both coasts in withdrawal from Rachel Maddow's nightly Kremlinology lesson can purchase a whole book to inspire paroxysms of rage...a veritable thirst trap for the easily microaggressed. It's all here. Rants about Trump derangement syndrome; MSNBC; #MeToo; safe spaces.\" (Bari Weiss, <i>The New York Times</i>)</p>";
