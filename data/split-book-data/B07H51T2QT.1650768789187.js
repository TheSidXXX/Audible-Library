Like a monk racking up combo points, the system opens a fresh offensive by crippling her most powerful ability. Following through, it strangles the village food supply, sends demons bursting through rifts in the Earth, and delivers a final, devastating throat punch by exploiting Devon’s worst fear.</p> <p>The players have discovered Devon’s home. Now everything changes.</p>";
