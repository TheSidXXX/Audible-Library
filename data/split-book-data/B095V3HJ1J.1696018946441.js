window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Andy Richter: TV icon and comedy legend, probably was born somewhere, grew up someplace, and maybe even did a bunch of stuff. All that boring garbage could be jammed into a classic celebrity biography, but to write that would take work and effort. Two things this Audible Original wasn’t about to stoop to.</p> <p>Jam-packed with misinformation, outright lies, and probable slander, <i>The Incredibly Inaccurate Biography of Andy Richter</i> is totally - and tonally - wrong. A “lie-ography,” if you will, manufactured by some of America’s funniest and most ignorant writers, each working independently of the others, all following one guiding principle: a mutual disregard for the truth. And a mutual disdain for Andy.</p> <p>Performed by Nick Offerman and disputed throughout by the actual Andy Richter, <i>TIIBOAR </i>traces the arc of Andy’s life, career, and even his ultimate passing (we just checked, and it turns out, he is unfortunately still alive). What’s more, it even covers his afterlife. How many biographies do that? (We did no research, but assume it is very few.)</p> <p>Contributing writers include <i>Jeopardy </i>champion Ken Jennings, comedy legend Andy Daly, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Samantha Irby, and writers from <i>The Simpsons</i>, <i>Big Bang Theory</i>, <i>Modern Family</i>, <i>Conan</i>, and many more.&nbsp;</p>";
