Well, there was a father; what did you expect? She’s pissed. Someone killed her lover, and now they will pay.</p> <p>Still tasked with figuring out who or what is responsible for the chaos, Jeff must also figure out what the heck a Manipulator Class is. To help him on this journey, former GMs Torvi and Snapdragon will apply their extensive knowledge of the game to power-level Jeff and attempt to restore normalcy to the game.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dak, Jeweliette, Oliver, and the rest of the party find themselves stuck in the next questline to destroy dragon after dragon after dragon...after dragon. Maybe Dan Shaklee should just pull the plug already...</p> <p><i>Manipulating Magic </i>is book two of the Jeff the Game Master series. It picks up where the first left off, and his exploits are only half the fun. Experience a unique spin on the LitRPG genre, not just providing the perspective of the players, but also of one of those mystical, magical, all-powerful GMs we all dream of being.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
