window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>LAPD Detective Harry Bosch seeks justice for the forgotten in this original story from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Michael Connelly</b></p> <p>An anonymous tip puts Bosch on a case that has remained unsolved for decades, the vicious stabbing of a teenage boy whose body was found in an abandoned Old Hollywood restaurant.</p> <p>Cold cases are often the toughest: With no body, no murder scene, and no fingerprints, Bosch nevertheless gets lucky when DNA evidence from the murder weapon points to a known killer. But the DA insists that science alone is not enough - he needs the case to be bulletproof before he'll take it to court.</p> <p>Determined to speak for those who can no longer speak for themselves, Bosch has one chance to wrench a confession out of a cold-blooded killer, or risk letting him walk free for good.</p> <p>In this gripping, never-before-published story by \"master of the crime thriller\" (<i>Huffington Post </i>) Michael Connelly, Detective Harry Bosch quenches his thirst for justice and shows why he is \"one of the most popular and enduring figures in American crime fiction\" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>).</p>";
