window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Are you truly in danger or has your brain simply \"tricked\" you into thinking you are? In <i>The Worry Trick</i>, psychologist and anxiety expert David Carbonell shows how anxiety hijacks the brain and offers effective techniques to help you break the cycle of worry, once and for all. </p> <p>Anxiety is a powerful force. It makes us question ourselves and our decisions, causes us to worry about the future, and fills our days with dread and emotional turbulence. Based in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), this audiobook is designed to help you break the cycle of worry. </p> <p>Worry convinces us there's danger, and then tricks us into getting into fight, flight, or freeze mode - even when there is no danger. The techniques in this audiobook, rather than encouraging you to avoid or try to resist anxiety, show you how to see the trick that underlies your anxious thoughts, and how avoidance can backfire and make anxiety worse. </p> <p>If you're ready to start observing your anxious feelings with distance and clarity - rather than getting tricked once again - this audiobook will show you how. </p>";
