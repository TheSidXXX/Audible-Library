window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When I’m offered the chance to leave New York to live in London for three months, I can’t pack my suitcase fast enough. As soon as I touch down, I’m obsessing over red telephone boxes, palaces, and all the black cabs. But my favorite place is the tube. It’s wall-to-wall hot British men in suits.</p> <p>When I’m offered a temporary job working for a barrister, I say, sign me up. On my first commute into work, it’s a total accident when I lose my balance and fall against the most handsome Brit alive. He’s as charming as James Bond and as suave as Mr. Darcy. I want to lick tea from his hard abs and listen to his accent all night long.&nbsp;</p> <p>Turns out Mr. Handsome is my new boss. And his attitude isn’t as hot as his gorgeous face, broad shoulders, and tight ass. He’s brooding, short-tempered, and the most arrogant man I’ve ever met.</p> <p>As we’re fighting, out of nowhere he kisses me. And I’m pretty sure I see fireworks over Big Ben and hear \"God Save the Queen\". I wasn’t looking for the fairy tale, but I might have found my knight in shining armor. The problem is he lives an ocean away.</p> <p>A sexy stand-alone romance.</p> <p>For Harper and Max's story, listen to <i>King of Wall Street</i></p> <p>For Scarlett and Ryder's story, listen to <i>The Duke of Manhattan</i></p> <p>For Darcy and Logan's story, listen to <i>The Earl of London</i></p> <p>For Grace and Sam's story, listen to <i>Park Avenue Prince&nbsp;</i></p>";
