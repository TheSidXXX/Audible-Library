Fiends' Night, when the boundary between Vuldranni and hell is the weakest.</p> <p>And so hell comes out to play.</p> <p>To survive the night, Montana must put his entire holding on lockdown and turn hastily made cave apartments into an actual, inviting home for thousands of Coggeshall residents. Most of whom don't really know or like each other. And all of whom have different ideas of what needs to be done on Fiends' Night.</p> <p>So, intent on becoming the duke his people deserve, Montana spends the night flitting about Imperial balls, handing out gifts to children, squeezing through kobold tunnels, and building with the dwarves. It's his hand-shaking, baby-kissing time to shine.</p> <p>Oh, except that The Master he just took care of in Osterstadt? That was the wrong one.</p> <p>The real Master is hiding in Coggeshall, and Montana has to catch him before the entire holding becomes his dinner.</p>";
