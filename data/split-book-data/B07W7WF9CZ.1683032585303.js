The wait was definitely worth it as they entered into a game world that was virtually indistinguishable from real life - apart from the obvious game elements of course.</p> <p>After starting in a typical starting town, they learned everything they needed to survive in this new world. Journeying through the wilderness outside of town, the duo progressed at a good pace until they arrived at the starting dungeon. Their lives were drastically changed by this place with the unassuming name of \"Goblin Cave\".</p> <p>After finding themselves in charge of their very own dungeon, Devin and Krista must figure out how to survive and thrive - all while fending off invading players.</p> <p>This first book is a stat and table-heavy LitRPG Dungeon Core story - perfect for those who love stats and tables!</p>";
