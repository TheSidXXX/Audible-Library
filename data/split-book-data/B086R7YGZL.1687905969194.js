window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Where Man Meets Magic and Machine....</b></p> <p>The year is 2050. The power of magic and the creatures it brings have returned to the earth, and many of the ancient races have re-emerged. Elves, Orks, Mages, and lethal Dragons find a home in a world where mana, technology, and human flesh have melded into deadly urban predators. And the multinational mega-corporations that run the world hoard the only thing of real value - information.</p> <p>For Sam Verner, living in the womb of the Renraku conglomerate was easy, until his sister disappeared and the fa√ßade of the corporate reality began to disintegrate. Now he wants out, but to \"extract\" himself he has to slide like a whisper through the deadly shadows the corporations cast, into a completely different world where his first wrong move may be his last...the world of Shadowrun.</p>";
