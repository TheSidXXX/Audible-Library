window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Letty Davenport, the brilliant and tenacious adopted daughter of Lucas Davenport, takes the investigative reins in the newest thriller from number one best-selling author John Sandford.</b></p> <p>By age 24, Letty Davenport has seen more action and uncovered more secrets than many law enforcement professionals. Now a recent Stanford grad with a master’s in economics, she’s restless and bored in a desk job for US Senator Colles. Letty’s ready to quit, but her skills have impressed Colles, and he offers her a carrot: feet-on-the-ground investigative work, in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several oil companies in Texas have reported thefts of crude, Colles tells her. He isn’t so much concerned with the oil as he is with the money: Who is selling the oil, and what are they doing with the profits? Rumor has it that a fairly ugly militia group - led by a woman known only as Lorelai - might be involved. Colles wants to know if the money is going to them, and if so, what they’re planning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Letty is partnered with a DHS investigator, John Kaiser, and they head to Texas.&nbsp;When the case quickly turns deadly, they know they’re on the track of something bigger. Lorelai and her group have set in motion an explosive&nbsp;plan...and the clock is ticking down.</p>";
