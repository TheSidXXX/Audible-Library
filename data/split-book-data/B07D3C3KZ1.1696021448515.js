But she's got problems of her own, and he might not be able to help her.</p> <p>Fortunately for the little golem, he's quick to find allies, learn skills, gain levels, and survive horrible predicaments. Which is good, because his creator has a whole lot of enemies â€¦</p> <p>Warning: Contains profanity and violence.</p>";
