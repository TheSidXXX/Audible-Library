window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After seven national best sellers and eight seasons as one of the most successful shows on television, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jeff Lindsay bids a thrilling farewell to his uniquely twisted and beloved serial killer, Dexter Morgan. <i>Dexter Is Dead</i> is the definitive conclusion of the character who has become a global icon. </p> <p>Dexter Morgan has burned the candle at both ends for many years: blood spatter analyst...husband...father...serial killer. And now, for the first time, his world has truly collapsed. Dexter is arrested on charges of murder. He has lost everything - including his wife, his kids, and the loyalty of his sister. Now completely alone, Dexter faces a murder charge (for a crime, ironically, he did not actually commit). His only chance for freedom lies with his brother, Brian, who has a dark plan to prove Dexter's innocence. But the stakes are deadly, and the epic showdown that lies in Dexter's path may lead, once and for all, to his demise. </p> <p>Jeff Lindsay's trademark devilish wit and cutting satire have never been sharper. <i>Dexter Is Dead</i> marks the end of a beloved series, but is also Dexter's most satisfying and suspenseful outing yet. </p>";
