window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Sam Ryder. I was abducted from Earth and brought to a planet called Tor, a world of dying goddesses and deadly monsters. I was leveled up - twice now - transformed from a slightly overweight gamer with no real career prospects into a man-beast capable of slinging a massive hammer around like it's made of feathers and cotton.</p> <p>At this point I've already faced one of the massive demon overlords known as the Morgoss - those who are responsible for the overthrow of the Three goddesses and the predicament we find ourselves in. But I survived, along with several of my allies.</p> <p>This is the continuation of my story.</p> <p><i>Note: This book has monster slaying, cursing, heavy violence, and a group of exotic goddesses and alien women. Mature listeners only.</i></p>";
