window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You take out one annoying vampire in revenge, and now you have to clean up the mess? What a pain in the...something. </p> <p>Bethany Anne and crew are back! They need to grab a ship, figure out who is trying to dig into her businesses, get their hands around the potential for creating an AI and the ongoing mess with Anton and South America. </p> <p>One of these days, she will get a break. Fortunately for us, it wasn't today. </p> <p>Got an attitude? That's nice. Just don't show it around Bethany Anne. When she slaps a face off, the whole head goes with it. </p> <p><i>Bite This</i>, book four in The Kurtherian Gambit series, follows the story after <i>Love Lost</i>. If you haven't listened to the preceding books, you pretty much have to. These are a series and many of the characters have been introduced in preceding volumes. </p> <p>Please note: There is flagrantly foul language in this novel. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing. </p>";
