window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Eyes Wide Open: How to Make Smart Decisions in a Confusing World</i> is Noreen Hertz's practical, cutting-edge guide to help you cut through the data deluge and make smarter and better choices, based on her highly popular TED talk. </p> <p>In this eye-opening handbook, the internationally noted speaker, economics expert, and bestselling author of <i>IOU: The Debt Threat </i>and <i>Silent Takeover</i> reveals the extent to which the biggest decisions in our lives are often made on the basis of flawed information, weak assumptions, corrupted data, insufficient scrutiny of others, and a lack of self-knowledge. </p> <p>To avert such disasters, Hertz persuasively argues, we need to become empowered decision-makers, capable of making high-stakes choices and holding accountable those who advise us. </p> <p>In <i>Eyes Wide Open</i>, she weaves together scientific research with real-world examples from Hollywood to Harry Potter, NASA to World War Two spies, to construct a path to more astute and empowered decision-making in ten clear steps. With a razor-sharp intellect and an instinct for popular storytelling, she offers counter-intuitive, actionable guidance for making better choices - whether you are a business-person, a professional, a patient, or a parent. </p>";
