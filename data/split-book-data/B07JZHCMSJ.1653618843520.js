Though not a question Jeremiah ever expected to ponder, he is nevertheless looking forward to seeing what the aforementioned duo will cook up. Success or failure does not matter to Richard, only that the journey be entertaining.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Things are far less jovial for the one under Tom's \"care\", however. Stuck in the monster-infested wilderness, lacking the usual backup, hunted by the Empire's top brass, and tasked with an incredibly vague and obtuse Quest, Boxxy will face a world of uncertainty and adversity. However, this is nothing new. Pain, suffering, and loss are things that have been commonplace since day one, and Boxxy is not only entirely undaunted, but also eager to share those valuable lessons with its new \"companion\". With things both shiny and tasty on the line, the crafty killer has every intention of showing that lich who's boss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Assuming Boxxy manages to find it, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Content warning: profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content.</p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Jeff Hays - narration, music, and sound design&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Dalton Lynne - editing and proofing&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Griffin Malnar - editing and mastering</li> </ul>";
