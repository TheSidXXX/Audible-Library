window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p></p> <p>One town. One murder. One million hot dogs.</p> <p>Welcome to Argyle. Grab a hot dog and allow town narrator Jeremy Zax (Bob Odenkirk) to regale you with this region’s rich history! Founded in 1843 by settlers with their sights set on California, these brave souls grew too tired and instead settled for Ohio. Argylites love to celebrate the spirit of “close enough,” like that of Richie McDonough (Brian Posehn) a young man who was a stupendous substitute bowler that never bowled and instead kept the bench warm. His untimely, mysterious death in the Summer of 2013 is Argyle’s darkest secret.</p> <p>Hear how Richie met his fate, beginning with Argyle’s annual hot dog eating contest and ending with the town’s annual murder. Along the way, you’ll see that Argyle truly has it all: a DMV that’s also a fancy restaurant; the world’s largest lost-and-found; a surgeon who doubles as a magician; and so much more!</p> <p>Created and written by Nate Odenkirk (The New Yorker, The Onion) and his father Bob Odenkirk (Mr. Show, Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad), <i>Summer in Argyle</i> is proudly Audible’s second best murder comedy. This offbeat Audible Original features some of today’s biggest comedy stars, like David Cross (Arrested Development), Tim Robinson (I Think You Should Leave), Paul F. Tompkins (Comedy Bang! Bang!), plus Carl Tart, Stephanie Courtney, Lyric Lewis, Stephanie Hsu, andmore. <i>Summer in Argyle</i> is like listening to an old-time radio theatre show soaked in silly and blended with absurdity to produce a perfect froth of nonsense.</p> <p>As they say in Argyle: Welcome to Argyle - and welcome, to YOU.</p> <p>Visit Audible Sounds Funny</p>";
