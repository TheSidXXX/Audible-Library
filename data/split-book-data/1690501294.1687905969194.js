window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Enter the world of Metamorphosis Online, a fully immersive video game where players compete for spots in the Global Top 10 - ranks that actually pay you to play the game. Gracie doesn't play the game to make money...at first. Broke, single, and working a crappy job as a blackjack dealer, Gracie's just blowing off steam and having fun. Can playing a new type of immersive game help her overcome real-life issues, or will it cause more problems?&nbsp;</p> <p>Before she knows it, Gracie has intervened in a generations-long war between the kobolds and the fae and started a ragtag guild, and her weird math abilities make themselves known in a way that most could not have imagined. Can she deal with being pitted against the game developers?&nbsp;</p> <p>For the first time Gracie can remember, she has something worth fighting for.</p>";
