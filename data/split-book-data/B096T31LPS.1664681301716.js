He must learn the art of combat and how to control the powerful abilities that surface in his body. Northblood, they’ll call him. A blessing and a curse.</p> <p>On the bright side, he’s totally buff. And there’s this hot redheaded game tester who was pulled from her old life and shoved into his.</p> <p>Things could definitely be worse.</p>";
