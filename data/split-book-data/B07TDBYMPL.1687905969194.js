What if you and your friends were assholes?</p> <p>Would you have what it takes to survive? The strength? The wisdom? The...charisma?</p> <p>Do you have the dice in your sack?</p> <p>It's like <i>Lord of the Rings</i> meets your mom in a truck stop bathroom, but even cheaper.</p> <p>This set includes:</p> <ol> <li><i>Critical Failures</i></li> <li><i>Critical Failures II: Fail Harder</i></li> <li><i>Critical Failures III: A Storm of S-Words</i></li> <li><i>Critical Failures IV: The Phantom Pinas</i></li> </ol>";
