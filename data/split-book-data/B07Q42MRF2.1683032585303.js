window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Devon has faced off with half-mad zombie frogmen, a demon war priestess, and a thousand-year-old curse.&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>But can she survive another attempt to cook dinner?&nbsp;</b></p> <p>You know, sometimes it would be nice to catch a break. Devon, a professional gamer, has a settlement to grow into a city, a character she'd love to focus on leveling, and some kitchen cabinets that really need restocking.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, the fate of the Relic Online game world is at stake, torn asunder by battling creator AIs. Demons rise through planar rifts, rampaging across the physical realm. The ancient city of Ishildar holds power that might turn the tide. If only Devon, the brave heroine chosen as the city's champion, could finish her epic quest line to gain control of the place.&nbsp;</p> <p>The in-game events would be challenge enough if she weren't confronted with disasters in the real world. After a horrifying mountain bike crash, Devon's friend, Tamara, needs her support. Emerson, a programmer from the gaming company, can't unravel the troubling actions of the demonic AI, Zaa, without Devon's help.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yeah, there's the little problem of a raid force of anarchist players coming to demolish Stonehaven, the only true home Devon has ever known.&nbsp;</p> <p>No problem, right?</p>";
