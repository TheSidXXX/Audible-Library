But what happens after you step through a portal to another world, well....</p> <p>For stage magician Quinn Bradley, he thought his time in Alissia was over. He’d done his job for the mysterious company CASE Global Enterprises, and now his name is finally on the marquee of one of the biggest Vegas casinos. And yet, for all the accolades, he definitely feels something is missing. He can create the most amazing illusions on Earth, but he’s also tasted&nbsp;<i>true&nbsp;</i>power.&nbsp;<i>Real&nbsp;</i>magic.&nbsp;</p> <p>He misses it.</p> <p>Luckily - or not - CASE Global is not done with him, and they want him to go back. The first time, he was tasked with finding a missing researcher. Now, though, he has another task:</p> <p>Help take Richard Holt&nbsp;<i>down</i>.</p> <p>It’s impossible to be in Vegas and&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>be a gambler. And while Quinn might not like his odds - a wyvern nearly ate him the last time he was in Alissia - if he plays his cards right, he might be able to aid his friends.</p> <p>He also might learn how to use real magic himself.</p>";
