window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mankind hangs on by a thread in the wake of the apocalypse. Other races are soon to join the struggle for power on Earth. The Culling of Man was only the beginning....</p> <p>Scattered across the globe, ten Dungeons may provide humanity with the protection and power they'll need to remain relevant through the perils to come. <br> <br> Before a Dungeon can be claimed, it must be conquered. <br> <br> Garath's goal is clear: Claim the nearest Dungeon for humanity. But he can't do it alone. Old friends and new acquaintances band together to form an elite team and take on The Tower of Vy'thishrak. <br> <br> In the second installation of Peril's Prodigy, we take a closer look at several new Classes and abilities. Explore a plethora of new dungeons. Finally find out what's inside that damned mysterious egg. And watch Garath's group of survivors in their attempt to claim The Tower. <br> <br> Disclaimer: There are still no hot elves.&nbsp;</p>";
