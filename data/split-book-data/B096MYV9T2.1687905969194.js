window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Gen-Z slang is everywhere, there’s no point denying it. It’s not like Klingon, either. You can’t ignore it into oblivion. It’s here to stay.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pop culture, digital marketing, movies, TV shows, books, and the entire internet in general is affected by this evolved diction. Words that previously had no meaning, words like \"yeet\" and \"okurr\", are now not only being recognized by and large by a whole demographic, but are also being used as part of their daily vocabulary.&nbsp;</p> <p>This book, although not exhaustive, serves to help you understand and decode popular Gen-Z slang terms, tries to explore their rich history, and aims to make you become better versed in the colloquial speech of the young and trendy.</p> <p>We’ll discuss possible origins of this language, how internet culture influenced the formation and propagation of these quirky phrases, and then, we’ll take a look at some of the most popular and common terms, catchphrases, and codewords out there.&nbsp;</p> <p>We shall also go through Gen-Z’s dating slang, with commentary on how the modern landscape of myriad platforms and services has made what was once an arduous and romantic endeavor (dating) convenient, low-effort, and has simplified it to the point where it’s conventional to find someone online as opposed to being odd.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you’re into history, if discovering the origins of things piques your curiosity, or if you’re simply looking to flex on the younger crowd that you know their terminologies and their secret language, this book will be a good primer for you while keeping things fun, casual, and light.</p> <p><b>Start speaking Gen-Z slang, buy now!</b></p>";
