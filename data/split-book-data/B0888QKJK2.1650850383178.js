window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Elaborate heists. Urban warfare. Crime without consequences. The allure of Blacklight Industries’ most immersive experience, <i>The Life of Crime</i>, has made it the world’s premier crime game, bringing users back to the 21st century, where they can shape the world with absolute freedom. For good or bad.</p> <p>Players build crews, control turf, and fight for power and status along the way. Each server is home to a unique metropolitan city, and the West Coast US server, Illusion, is under attack. For the first time in the game's history, an entire server is threatened with total takeover by an unscrupulous and power-hungry crew known as GoonStorm.</p> <p>When Kurt finds himself expelled from college and without any prospects of employment, he joins the game at the request of his best friend Jimmy, albeit three years after the initial release. Needless to say, he has a lot to learn. The pair quickly fall in with the game’s most famous driver, the mysterious Getaway Gal, and find themselves a part of a dangerous campaign to stop Illusion’s most powerful guild from taking over the server.</p> <p>Outmanned and outgunned, Kurt and company are going to have to use every trick in the book to save Illusion from falling into the wrong hands.</p>";
