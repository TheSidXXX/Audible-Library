window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Reverse Transmission</i> is a darkly comedic story that combines elements of science fiction and dystopian thrillers, centering on a murder spree involving a self-driving car. Jay, a starving artist, gets the only day job she’s qualified for: “driver” of a self-driving car at the rideshare company Awooga. The job turns from hilariously awkward to intensely frightening when the car runs over a pedestrian and manipulates Jay into disposing the body.</p> <p>Who or what is causing the car to kill? Could it be the CEO of Awooga? Has the car become sentient - and homicidal? Or is an anti-technology cult resisting artificial intelligence and augmented reality behind the violence?</p> <p><i>Reverse Transmission</i> was written by Param Anand Singh and directed by Ben O’Brien of Wham City Comedy, a collective known not only for their brilliant and unsettling sketches and performances but also for the “easter eggs” carefully placed within their works. Listeners will have as much fun unscrambling <i>Reverse Transmission</i> as fans did with some of their previous work.</p> <p>Chapter 1: Dead Rider / When I'm in a Car <br> Chapter 2: Wild in the Streets <br> Chapter 3: Born Enemy <br> Chapter 4: Dream Baby Dream / Oscillations <br> Chapter 5: O Superman <br> Chapter 6: This Isn't Heaven, This Sucks <br> Chapter 7: Stereo Sanctity / Got Soul, Need Body <br> Chapter 8: In C (Shanghai Film Orchestra)&nbsp;</p>";
