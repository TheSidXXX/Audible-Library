window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Questing Stones have come to Nowherested, and Evelia Greene is finally ready to receive her life's quest. Perhaps she'll be a great warrior, or a wealthy merchant, or a brilliant mage. Perhaps her quest is simply to live a quiet life, constantly honing a craft to the heights of perfection.&nbsp;</p> <p>Or perhaps the Questing Stones will grant her the legendary mission of popping over to the next village to pick up a loaf of bread.&nbsp;</p> <p>Wouldn’t that be ridiculous?&nbsp;</p> <p>Eve can’t even begin to guess how or why she’s come by such an absurd life goal, nor how a level-one messenger girl is supposed to complete anything labeled as legendary, but at least she can be sure of one thing. No matter how many wolves or goblins attack, no matter how many speeding tickets she racks up, no matter how many bakeries spontaneously combust as she steps into town, one way or another, Eve is going to get that goddamned bread.&nbsp;</p> <p>There just might be a few side quests along the way.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>This book contains game elements, good jokes, bad jokes, worse jokes, and language strong enough to lift weights. Please enjoy.</b></p>";
