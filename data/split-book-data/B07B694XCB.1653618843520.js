window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Fiendishly inventive.\" (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)</p> <p>Chengdu, China: The vibrant capital of Sichuan Province is suddenly held hostage when a shocking manifesto is released by an anonymous vigilante known as Eumenides. It is a bold declaration of war against a corrupt legal system, with Eumenides acting as judge and executioner.&nbsp;</p> <p>The public starts nominating potential targets, and before long hundreds of names are added to his kill list. Eumenides' cunning game has only just begun. First, he publishes a “death notice” announcing his next target, the crimes for which the victim will be punished, and the date of the execution. The note is a deeply personal taunt to the police. Everyone knows who is going to die and when it's going to happen, but the police fail to stop the attack.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 4/18 Task Force, an elite group of detectives and specialists, is assembled to catch Eumenides before he strikes again. In the process, they discover alarming connections to an 18-year-old cold case, and they find out that some members of the team have much to hide.</p>";
