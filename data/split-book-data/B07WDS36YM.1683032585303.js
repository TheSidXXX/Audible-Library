If he’s going to weather what’s to come and topple the Tyrant King, he’ll have to unlock the secrets of the stolen World Stone Pendant, master his new Hexorcist class, form some very unlikely allies, and most important...grief some heroes. Let the games begin!</p> <p>From James A. Hunter, author of the litRPG epic <i>Viridian Gate Online</i>, and eden Hudson, author of&nbsp;<i>Path of the Thunderbird</i>&nbsp;and the Jubal Van Zandt Series, comes an exciting new litRPG, dungeon-core adventure you won’t want to put down!</p>";
