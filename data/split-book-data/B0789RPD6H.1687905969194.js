The problem? He doesn't know which god. And the promised war hasn't started yet.</p> <p>With the Four Horsemen refusing to help, and an army of monsters living on his lawn, Nate resorts to the one thing he's best at - pissing off demigods and Greek Heroes in hopes of jump-starting the war.</p> <p>But then he receives an ominous invitation that he literally cannot refuse. A dark, deadly place where nightmares roam free demands an audience. The Land of the Fae.</p> <p>He must forget every story he's heard about the Fae. They're nothing like he imagined, nothing like he's been told... But to kill a god, he must first become a monster.</p>";
