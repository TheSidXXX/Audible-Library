window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </i></b><b>meets </b><b><i>Jumanji </i></b><b>in the second book in the laugh-out-loud adventure series Homerooms and Hall Passes!&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Months after saving suburbia from destruction, our heroes are back to their old lives of dungeon delving and magical quests. All except the wizard Albiorix, who has given up adventuring and uses his time trying (unsuccessfully) to create his own board game.</p> <p>When the party finds its old friend June Westray’s smartphone for sale in a Bríandalörian bazaar, however, they fear the Realm of Suburbia is under threat. Thus, the five young adventurers must travel back into Homerooms &amp; Hall Passes, a role-playing game where they assume the characters of average American kids. This time they’re at level nine and will face a whole new set of challenges: their freshman year of high school!</p> <p>There are different cliques, different rules, and higher stakes. And if that wasn’t stressful enough, the heroes must track down an evil spellbook, defeat a sinister foe, and figure out how to get back home....&nbsp;</p>";
