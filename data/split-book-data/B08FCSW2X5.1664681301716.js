Now, the time has come for them to leave the forest and return to civilization. Neither Roy nor Aika know what to expect in the Itachi capital, but with their powerful teacher by their sides, they reluctantly agree to venture into the city.</p> <p>With all the time that has passed, they don't know how many powerful players are now on the board, nor the looming threat posed by a gathering of monstrous Beasts. The Sovereign of the Herald Clan has also learned that his son is alive and has ordered that he be returned by any means necessary.</p> <p>Roy faces many challenges, most of which Geon believes he will fail.
