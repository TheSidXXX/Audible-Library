window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Henry \"Hank\" Thompson's got a good thing going - a hut on a quiet Mexican beach, morning swims, a nice breakfast place a few miles down shore…until a backpacker with a Russian accent shows up and starts asking questions about his past. Questions Hank doesn't want to deal with. And then the backpacker mentions the money…and Hank's parents. So Hank makes a fateful move…because no one threatens Hank's family. Now Thompson is on the run - dodging federales and Russian mobsters, sneaking past the US Border Patrol, negotiating with nefarious businessmen, and trying desperately to avoid dying at the hands of two hell-bent surfer bums who fancy themselves his allies. The result is a full-throttle thriller, a cinematic adventure full of booze, bullets, loyalty, and love.</p>";
