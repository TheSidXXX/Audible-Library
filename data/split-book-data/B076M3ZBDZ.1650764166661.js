window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Mitherfickers are back and ready to bring the fight to the Shinigami! </p> <p>But before they can do that, they need an audience with the Knights of Non Compos Mentis, the most powerful guild in Tritania. Luckily for them, Ryuk used to be a member of the famed guild, and to get to the guild headquarters, they'll need to level up and figure out a way into a city heightened tight security. </p> <p>Along their journey to Polynya, the second floating continent of Tritania, the Mitherfickers are joined by a high elf, whose village is being terrorized by a big bad wolf. </p> <p>Hijinks and violence ensues as they attempt to rid the village of this wolf, the results of which end up opening their guild to new members from a different Proxima world, something Hiccup the goblin isn't too happy about. </p> <p>Things heat up after the motley guild adventure through the catacombs beneath the city of Porthos, where they are framed for attempted murder and placed in the Empress' dungeon. With no way out, one of the Mitherfickers reveals a secret the likes of which will change the guild's standing in Tritania forever. </p> <p>Narrated by Jeff Hays, the voice of the Proxima Galaxy, this book has loads of tie-ins with the other Proxima galaxy books including The Feedback Loop series and <i>The Last Warrior of Unigaea</i>. </p>";
