window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Charlie Wheelan and his family do what others dream of: They take a year off to travel the world. This is their story.</b></p> <p>What would happen if you quit your life for a year? In a pre-COVID-19 world, the Wheelan family decided to find out; leaving behind work, school, and even the family dogs to travel the world on a modest budget. Equal parts \"how-to\" and \"how-not-to\" - and with an eye toward a world emerging from a pandemic - <i>We Came, We Saw, We Left </i>is the insightful and often hilarious account of one family's gap-year experiment.</p> <p>Wheelan paints a picture of adventure and connectivity, juggling themes of local politics, global economics, and family dynamics while exploring answers to questions like: How do you sneak out of a Peruvian town that has been barricaded by the local army? And where can you get treatment for a flesh-eating bacteria your daughter picked up two continents ago? From Colombia to Cambodia, <i>We Came, We Saw, We Left </i>chronicles nine months across six continents with three teenagers. What could go wrong?</p>";
