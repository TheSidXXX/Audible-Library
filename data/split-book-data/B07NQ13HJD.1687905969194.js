She’s funny, sexy, and vulnerable and throws me out of bed before I can catch my breath and suggest breakfast.</p> <p>When I start my last undercover job on a yacht, turns out she’s one of the crew. I try, but I can’t look away.</p> <p>Her high ponytail shows off her kissable neck that tastes like summer.</p> <p>Her short uniform reveals the killer legs that were wrapped around me last night.</p> <p>And her provocative smile? I know what that mouth is capable of.</p> <p>I want to explore her body, discover her secrets, and sail off into the sunset with her.</p> <p>I might want to go all in for Skylar, but she should stay away from me.</p> <p>I’ve got secrets of my own, and they can only bring her trouble.</p>";
