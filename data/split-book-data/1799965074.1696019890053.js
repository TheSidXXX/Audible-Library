Welcome to Steele Ranch, where the men are hot, dominant, and know what they want.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>For Cord Connolly and Riley Jamison, that’s sexy and sinfully sweet Kady Parks.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Philadelphia school teacher discovers she’s the heir - along with half-sisters she didn’t know existed - to the Steele fortune, including a real-life cattle ranch. Instead of spending her summer break at home, she’s in Barlow, Montana. And the West is as wild as she imagined, for two hot cowboys have decided to lay claim, taking her for one wild ride. And Kady? She’s ready to dig in her spurs and hang on tight.</p>";
