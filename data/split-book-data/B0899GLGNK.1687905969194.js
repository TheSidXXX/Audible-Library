window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The afterlife isn't always what you think....</b></p> <p>A loving father of three children, Albert lived a life of few regrets. He served his country far from home. He outlived his soul mate. He died alone.</p> <p>However, his assumptions about a peaceful eternity, reunited with his wife, are thrown out the window when a meddling god digs his fingers into Albert's afterlife.</p> <p>The positive? He <i>will</i> have a chance to see his wife again.</p> <p>The negative? He has to survive the dangers of the legendary World Tree for the next 300 years. He's been reincarnated into a world full of magical evolutions, monstrous deer, sassy 10-year-old elves, and untold hidden dangers. It won't be easy, but if life has taught Albert anything it's this: If something is worth having, it's worth fighting for. And he intends to fight.</p>";
