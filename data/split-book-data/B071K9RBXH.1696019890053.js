window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the creator of the best-selling horror video game series Five Nights at Freddy's comes the sequel to <i>The Silver Eyes</i>. </p> <p>It's been a year since the horrific events at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, and Charlie is just trying to move on. Even with the excitement of a new school and a fresh start, she's still haunted by nightmares of a masked murderer and four gruesome animatronic puppets. Charlie thinks her ordeal is over, but when a series of bodies are discovered near her school - bearing wounds that are disturbingly familiar - she finds herself drawn back into the world of her father's frightening creations. Something twisted is hunting Charlie, and this time if it finds her, it's not letting her go. </p>";
