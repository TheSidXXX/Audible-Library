window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two old dudes want to kill me. Oh, and one of them is my ancestor....</b></p> <p>And after centuries of practice, they’re pretty good at the whole murder thing. But at least they want to kill each other just as badly.</p> <p>Now, I’ve taken down a Greek goddess, worn a Horseman’s mask, and I ride a homicidal unicorn who hates rainbows with a passion. Some might say sending two senior citizens to a permanent retirement home should be a breeze.</p> <p>It ain’t.</p> <p>Because that’s not my biggest concern. One of my friends is in danger, or possibly dying, and I need to get her back before her fiancé kills me. But finding her introduces me to new worlds of pain. The biggest of these being my own past - which has been a blatant lie - and a parting gift from my parents - which might have just been the coin toss for the Apocalypse Olympics.</p> <p>I’m beginning to realize that none of the old gods, legends, or monsters have been idle the last few centuries. They’ve been waiting, picking sides, and scheming schemes.</p> <p>Of course, maybe one of those two old dudes will punch my ticket and save me the headache. A wizard can hope, right? Because either way, I’m about to have a very bad series of days....</p> <p>If you like Jim Butcher, Kevin Hearne, Ilona Andrews, Linsey Hall, McKenzie Hunter, or Ella Summers, you will <b>love </b>the eighth installment of the Temple Chronicles.</p>";
