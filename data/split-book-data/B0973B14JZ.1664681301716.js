window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An apocalypse. An epic change in biology. Humanity’s new powers. No instructions. So, everyone created their own!</b></p> <p>Born over a century after \"The Rise\", Jeff scavenges with his tyrannical mother for survival. Banned from cultivating freely, Jeff wants none of this life; his one objective is to join the immortal rankers as they attempt to climb the Northern Tower. On the day of his escape, a powerful guild attacks Leah’s group, and Jeff is thrown through a unique dungeon portal—a portal that hasn’t been used in nearly a hundred years.</p> <p>In the pursuit of Jeff’s ultimate goal, he must choose whether to follow the Church, join a guild, or try it all on his own. Predators don’t only come from dungeons, and he must dig through mountains of misinformation for one straight answer.</p> <p><i>When spells and skills unleash chaos, a special blue screen powers up, and Jeff’s journey to the peak or the grave begins.</i></p>";
