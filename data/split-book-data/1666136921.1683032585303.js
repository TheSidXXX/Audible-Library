window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Submissive women have needs just like anybody else. But how can a woman get her needs met when she's relinquished her power to her dominant partner? With warmth, wisdom, and a down-to-earth approach, experienced submissive Kacie Cunningham analyzes the realities of the dominant-submissive lifestyle and suggests ways in which both partners can experience the greatest possible growth and pleasure. At the heart of the book is an emotion Kacie has dubbed \"Conquer Me\" - which she defines as \"the submissive's internal demand for a show of strength\". Without a clear understanding of \"conquer me\", both submissive and dominant may find themselves at odds - either fighting unhappily, or watching the passion ebb from their relationship. This book explains this unique need and how to get it met - essential knowledge for any submissive or couple who wants to get the most out of their D/s lifestyle.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
