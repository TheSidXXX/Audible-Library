window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After conquering all of Hesse, creating a devilish new dungeon, and establishing himself as the villain that everyone loves to hate, Lucas decides to continue his quest to create new content by taking over as a dungeon master on the mainland.</p> <p>Unlike the dominant force on the island he left behind, however, the once-mighty Imperium only controls a single capital city in a rapidly shrinking territory, leaving a group of scheming nobles to bicker among themselves and fight over scraps of land. Seen as an upstart and rabble-rouser, Lucas is instantly shunned and must struggle to find somewhere to begin building his new base. Now, after declaring himself the enemy of every man in the city, and with every player in the region hunting his head to claim the bounty placed there, Lucas has to decide which allies he can trust as he fights to stay alive long enough to establish a new lair and gain a foothold in a hostile land.</p> <p>Introducing new monsters, a curious new group member, and flashy new spells, this gamelit litRPG adventure follows Lucas as he writes his own story as the greatest villain the game world has ever known.</p> <p>\"Another amazing chapter of the Heroic Villain story from Charles Dean. An enthralling story by an author who just keeps hitting homeruns!\" (Dave Willmarth, writer of the Greystone Chronicles)</p> <p>This book is brought to you from the author of the litRPG series War Aeternus, <i>The Bathrobe Knight</i>, and <i>The Merchant of Tiqpa</i>.</p>";
