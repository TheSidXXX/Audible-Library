window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The definitive novel of today's Silicon Valley, </b><b><i>After On</i></b><b> flash-captures our cultural and technological moment with up-to-the-instant savvy. Matters of privacy and government intrusion, post-Tinder romance, nihilistic terrorism, artificial consciousness, synthetic biology, and much more are tackled with authority and brash playfulness by </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Rob Reid.</b></p> <p>Meet Phluttr - a diabolically addictive new social network and a villainess, heroine, enemy, and/or bestie to millions. Phluttr has ingested every fact and message ever sent to, from, and about her innumerable users. Her capabilities astound her makers - and they don't even know the tenth of it.&nbsp;</p> <p>But what's the purpose of this stunning creation? Is it a front for something even darker and more powerful than the NSA? A bid to create a trillion-dollar market by becoming \"The UberX of Sex\"? Or a reckless experiment that could spawn the digital equivalent of a middle-school mean girl with enough charisma, dirt, and cunning to bend the entire planet to her will?&nbsp;</p> <p>Phluttr has it in her to become the greatest gossip, flirt, or matchmaker in history. Or she could cure cancer, bring back <i>Seinfeld</i>, then start a nuclear war. Whatever she does, it's not up to us. But a motley band of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and engineers might be able to influence her.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>After On</i> achieves the literary singularity - fusing speculative satire and astonishing reality into a sharp-witted, ferociously believable, IMAX-wide view of our digital age.&nbsp;</p> <p>Narrated by Sean Kenin and January LaVoy, with:<br> Felicia Day: NETGRRRL.COM<br> Patrick Rothfuss: Special Field Operative Brock Hogan<br> John Hodgman: Charles Henry Higgensworth III<br> Tom Merritt: voice of <i>The New York Times</i><br> Jesse Cox: Whistle Blowings Blog<br> Leo Laporte: voice of <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i></p>";
