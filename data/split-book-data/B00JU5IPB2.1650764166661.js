window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sapna Sinha, an ordinary salesgirl in an electronics store in downtown Delhi, is approached by Vinay Mohan Acharya, a billionaire industrialist and one of India's richest men. He offers to make her CEO of his company. There is only one catch - she must pass seven tests from the \"textbook of life\". Thus begins the most challenging journey Sapna has ever undertaken - one that will test her character, her courage, and her capabilities. Along the way she encounters a host of memorable personalities, from a vain Bollywood superstar to a kleptomaniac Gandhian. At stake is a business empire worth 10 billion dollars and the future she has always dreamed of for herself and her family. But are the seven tests real? Or is Acharya playing a game driven by a perverse fantasy? </p> <p>Vikas Swarup, acclaimed author of <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>and <i>Six Suspects</i>, has written a compelling, suspenseful tale about the lure of money and the power of dreams. <i>The Accidental Apprentice</i> is international crime fiction at its most entertaining.</p>";
