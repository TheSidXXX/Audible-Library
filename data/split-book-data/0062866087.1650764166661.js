window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For generations, we've been stuck with a cookie-cutter mold for success that requires us to be the same as everyone else, only better. This \"standard formula\" works for some people but leaves most of us feeling disengaged and frustrated. As much as we might dislike the standard formula, it seems like there's no other practical path to financial security and a fulfilling life. But what if there is?&nbsp;</p> <p>In the Dark Horse Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, best-selling author and acclaimed thought leader Todd Rose and neuroscientist Ogi Ogas studied women and men who achieved impressive success even though nobody saw them coming. Dark horses blaze their own trail to a life of happiness and prosperity. Yet what is so remarkable is that hidden inside their seemingly one-of-a-kind journeys are practical principles for achieving success that work for anyone, no matter who you are or what you hope to achieve. This mold-breaking approach doesn't depend on you SAT scores, who you know, or how much money you have. The secret is a mind-set that can be expressed in plain English: Harness your individuality in the pursuit of fulfillment to achieve excellence.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Dark Horse</i>, Rose and Ogas show how the four elements of the dark horse mind-set empower you to consistently make the right choices that fit your unique interests, abilities, and circumstances and will guide you to a life of passion, purpose, and achievement.</p>";
