window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Humor, 2014</b></p> <p><b>A sharp, funny, and heartfelt memoir about fatherhood and the ups and downs of raising a family in modern America.</b> </p> <p>No one writes about family quite like Drew Magary. The <i>GQ</i> correspondent and <i>Deadspin </i>columnist's stories about trying to raise a family have attracted millions of readers online. And now he's finally bringing that unique voice to a memoir. In <i>Someone Could Get Hurt,</i> he reflects on his own parenting experiences to explore the anxiety, rationalizations, compromises, and overpowering love that come with raising children in contemporary America. </p> <p>In brutally honest and funny stories, Magary reveals how American mothers and fathers cope with being in over their heads (getting drunk while trick-or-treating, watching helplessly as a child defiantly pees in a hotel pool, engaging in role-play with a princess-crazed daughter), and how stepping back can sometimes make all the difference (talking a toddler down from the third story of a netted-in playhouse, allowing children to make little mistakes in the kitchen to keep them from making the bigger ones in life). It's a celebration of all the surprises - joyful and otherwise - that come with being part of a real family. </p> <p>In the wake of recent best sellers that expose how every other culture raises their children better, <i>Someone Could Get Hurt</i> offers a hilarious and heartfelt defense of American child rearing with a glimpse into the genuine love and compassion that accompany the missteps and flawed logic. It's the story of head lice, almost-dirty words, flat-head syndrome, and a man trying to commit the ultimate act of selflessness is a selfish world.</p>";
