window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Does your toaster oven make you feel shamefully inadequate with his lofty ideals and Jeffersonian views of the world? Is the letter Q the wrong shade of yellow? Are you frequently bothered by abstract images and geometric shapes falling from the sky? </p> <p>If so, this book can help. </p> <p><i>The Toaster Oven Mocks Me</i> is a humorous memoir that chronicles Steve's discovery, concealment, and eventual acceptance of synesthesia; a peculiar condition where one sense is stimulated, and two senses respond. </p> <p>It's like a \"buy one, get one free\" for your senses! </p> <p>But wait, there's more! Join Steve on his journey and experience the world as he does: </p> <p>Every letter and every number that you see, taking on its own distinct color. </p> <p>Visualizing dates in history and actually seeing a floating, holographic timeline just inches from your nose. </p> <p>And best of all, sensing personality from inanimate objects! </p> <p>But that's not all! </p> <p>Watch as our charismatic hero conceals his condition for decades using misdirection, clever tactics, and a sense of humor that only a mother could love. </p> <p>Order now and we'll throw in a mental breakdown at no extra charge! You read that right! You'll witness the inevitable outcome of hiding one's individuality for over four decades; and you'll occupy a front row seat as Steve finally figures out that uniqueness is something to be celebrated. </p> <p>Now how much would you pay? </p> <p>That's a brain condition and a mental collapse, for one low price! </p> <p>Order now! </p>";
