window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's been slightly over a year since Kellan Thorne first accepted the Sentinel's mantel, and its power was renewed in him. He thought destroying an Arch Demon and banishing his Chaotic opposite would have brought him more respite than it did. Now Creation itself is under threat, by a Cabal of Angels and Demons who have found a way to shatter the foundational pillars of Time itself. This dire warning is brought to the young Sentinel by an unlikely messenger, who risks all to enlist the aid of God's unchecked hand on the world. </p> <p>Kellan must decide if he will stay true to his dead master's teachings and oppose all unnatural beings, or risk everything by trusting that they might rise above their natures in defense of a common threat. This sets off a whirlwind effort that crosses both centuries and miles, as Kellan, Shannon, Meghan, and new allies try desperately to stay one step ahead of the Cabal. Their efforts will take them back to medieval Scotland and through modern day Egypt, Ethiopia, and Vatican City. Along the way, Kellan will face new threats and form new alliances as his motley crew does its best to prevent the Cabal from destroying all our yesterdays. </p>";
