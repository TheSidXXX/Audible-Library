window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earphones Award Winner (</b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>Winner, 2017 APA Audie Awards - Original Work</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>From master storyteller and Hugo Award-winner John Scalzi comes this Audible Original novella, winner of the 2017 Audie Award for Best Original Work. Emmy-nominated actor Zachary Quinto—best known for his roles as the Nimoy-approved Spock in the <i>Star Trek</i> reboot and the menacing, power-stealing serial killer Sylar in <i>Heroes</i>—brings his well-earned sci-fi credentials and simmering intensity to this genre-bending thriller.</p> <p>One day, not long from now, it becomes almost impossible to murder anyone—999 times out of a thousand, anyone who is intentionally killed comes back. How? We don't know. But it changes everything: war, crime, daily life.</p> <p>Enter Tony Valdez, professional Dispatcher. True to their name, these licensed assassins are tasked with humanely disposing of people in death’s crosshairs to offer them a second chance at avoiding the reaper. When a friend and fellow Dispatcher goes missing, Valdez is plunged into a web of intrigue both professional and personal.</p> <p>It's a race against time for Valdez to find his friend before it's too late...before not even a Dispatcher can save him.&nbsp;</p>";
