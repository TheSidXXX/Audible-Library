I was without a husband and a provider. Instead of wallowing in my grief, I buried myself in my work at Dovetail Enterprises. Landing the promotion as the CEO’s right hand was exactly what I needed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Getting saddled with Milo Huxley as an assistant is exactly the opposite.&nbsp;</p> <p>I can’t stand him.&nbsp;</p> <p>He’s arrogant, irresponsible, and out for my job. As if that’s not bad enough, he has to be devastatingly sexy, and have a posh English accent that makes me squirm on top of it all. I’ve had enough unpredictability for one lifetime, thank you.&nbsp;</p> <p>But soon enough, we’re fighting less and laughing more. He’s there for me when no one else is. And those good looks aren’t the only panty-dropping thing about him.&nbsp;</p> <p>If I only knew what to do about it....</p>";
