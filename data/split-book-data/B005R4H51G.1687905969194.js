window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dexter Morgan is not your average serial killer. He enjoys his day job as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department... but he lives for his nighttime hobby of hunting other killers. Dexter is therefore not pleased to discover that someone is shadowing him, observ足ing him, and copying his methods. Dexter is not one to tol足erate displeasure... in fact, he has a knack for extricating himself from trouble in his own pleasurable way. </p> <p>Like the previous five best-selling novels in the Dexter series, <i>Double Dexter</i> showcases the witty, macabre origi足nality that has propelled Jeff Lindsay to international suc足cess. Double Dexter is raucously entertaining... full of smart suspense and dark laughs. </p> <p><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p>";
