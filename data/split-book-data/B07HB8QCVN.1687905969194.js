And the girl he falls in love with may be sworn to kill him.</p> <p><i>Dark Light of Mine </i></p> <p>Hellhounds and demon spawn are out for blood. Justin's father is marked for death.</p> <p>Justin and Elyssa have to track down the mysterious person behind it all before it's too late.</p> <p><i>Fallen Angel of Mine </i></p> <p>During an escape from the gray men, Justin and Elyssa are stranded in Thunder Rock with a notorious Daemas, Kassallandra.
