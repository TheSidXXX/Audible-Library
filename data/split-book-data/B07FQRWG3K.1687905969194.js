He may only be a very small teddy bear, but he's got the persistence to plow through dungeons of rascally raccoon monsters, the wiles to turn a town full of undead on its ear, and the sanity to survive an encounter with a mediocre old one.</p> <p>However, Threadbare's little girl is growing up now, and her own path is hard and brutal. Will she even have a use for her old teddy bear when they meet again? Will they both survive the encounter?</p> <p>Warning: Contains profanity, violence, and a creepy villain who likes tentacles way too much.</p>";
