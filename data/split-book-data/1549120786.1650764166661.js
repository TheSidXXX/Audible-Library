Now that mentor, John Jack Thompson, is dead, but after his funeral his widow hands Bosch a murder book that Thompson took with him when he left the LAPD 20 years before - the unsolved killing of a troubled young man in an alley used for drug deals.</p> <p>Bosch brings the murder book to Ren√©e Ballard and asks her to help him find what about the case lit Thompson's fire all those years ago.
