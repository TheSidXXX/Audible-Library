window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two teenage were-dragons. Two terrible dads. A nest of vampires....</b></p> <p>Nate Temple and his pal, Alucard, just want a little peace and quiet after the events of <i>Tiny Gods</i>, but it just isn't in the cards for them. Tory leaves town and asks them to watch over the rebellious Reds. But they have other plans.</p> <p>When love is in the air, there is nothing a teenager wouldn't do. And there is nothing a dad wouldn't do to keep them safe. Even if it involves a Johnson Beaver concert, a magical djinn, and a herd of centaurs.</p> <p>This wild, fast-paced novella is a nice breather after the events of <i>Tiny Gods</i>, and brings back a whole lot of pain and humor to Nate Temple. If he can reason with the estrogen-filled shifter dragons before they burn Kansas City to the ground....</p> <p>If you like Jim Butcher, Kevin Hearne, Ilona Andrews, Linsey Hall, McKenzie Hunter, or Ella Summers, you will love this novella of the Temple Chronicles.</p>";
