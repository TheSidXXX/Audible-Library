The game in which your reputation and faction relationship are the only things that matter. These are the conditions of the agreement Ruslan signs without reading. </p> <p>The only thing he remembers is that he's been contracted to command a space fleet in a brand-new game he knows nothing about. Objective: to survive for six months. After having made some inevitable newbie mistakes, Ruslan has to rethink his strategy, dropping traditional gaming conventions. But what will it cost him? What new trials and tribulations await him that even the game designers have failed to anticipate? </p>";
