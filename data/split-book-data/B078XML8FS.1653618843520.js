Together, they've taken space by storm - and left a tradition of zaniness and laughter in their wake.... </p> <p>Desperate to kick Phule out of the Space Legion, General Blitzkrieg sends a crack team of environmental investigators - including celebrity canine Barky the Environmental Dog - to sniff out Phule and his unnatural disasters. </p> <p>It doesn't take long. Phule is hosting a group of big-game hunters who think they can bag a dinosaur on Zenobia. Needless to say, dinosaurs are not a native species. But cold, hard facts never stopped a Phule.... </p> <p>And neither will Barky's cold, wet nose. </p>";
