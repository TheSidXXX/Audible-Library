window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An exciting adventure from the world of Kalda, <i>A Thief's Way </i>is the companion story to the fantasy epic <i>A Prince's Errand</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Armed with a sardonic wit and a snarky tongue, Tilthan and his notorious thieving troupe embark for the Isle of Korath. Their purpose there is simple: steal the Eye of Rab'di, a gemstone rumored to hold magical properties. But all is not as it seems on Korath. Unexplained murders and mysterious deaths plague the city. Amid their heist, Tilthan and his gang stumble across the truth and are faced with a choice: steal the gem or escape with their lives.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Tales of the Amulet </b></p> <p>Several millennia ago, a war raged between the factions of dragonkind. With their world ravaged, the Kaldean Alliance forged the Amulet of Draconic Control and the Tethering Stone, and banished their foes to other realms, saving Kalda from utter destruction. Fearing the power of the Amulet, the survivors secreted it away. But now knowledge of the Amulet has resurfaced - and in the wrong hands, war could erupt anew.</p>";
