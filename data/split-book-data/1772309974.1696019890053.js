Me, my twin brother, Kyle, and our best friend, Aiden. We were inseparable all the way through high school.</p> <p>Did I picture myself with Aiden from the first moment I laid eyes on him back when we were eight? Hell. Yes. I fell in love with his soul that day. But he was always more Kyle’s friend than mine. And Kyle made damn sure we both know the rules.</p> <p>I was strictly off limits. Forever.</p> <p>But now, Kyle is gone. Dead from a freak accident. And Aiden is still here. Looking hot as hell in his grown-up body. Looking sexy AF with those tattoos all over his muscular chest. Sad and in need of comfort. Just like me.</p> <p><b>Aiden</b></p> <p>Every time Kyle caught me lusting after his twin sister, Kali, he reminded me of the rule. \"You were my friend first.\"</p> <p>If you want to get technical about it, I was Kali’s friend first, not Kyle’s.
