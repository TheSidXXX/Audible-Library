Victim of a terrible deception. A soldier once. Then a killer of his own kind. A butcher.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Nameless Dwarf</i> lies entombed beneath the earth, locked in an eternal sleep until the hour of Medryn-Tha's greatest need.&nbsp;</p> <p>With one shot at redemption, he must discover who he really is if he is to prevent the destruction of all the worlds and lead the dwarves to safety.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the deceptions that once cursed him have not been lain to rest. Every victory, every loss presents new dangers, new decisions.&nbsp;</p> <p>And history will remember him as the most cursed among the fallen....&nbsp;</p> <p>Or the greatest hero of legend.</p>";
