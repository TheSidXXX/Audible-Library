window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The third installment in the Zero G series by Dan Wells.&nbsp;</p> <p>Zero, Nyx, and the other <i>Pathfinder </i>colonists have adjusted to life on Kaguya. But Earth has built much faster starships-the <i>Dreamcatcher </i>arrives 10 years early, and the <i>Stargazer </i>arrives so early it actually got there before the <i>Pathfinder </i>did! Now the <i>Stargazer </i>is a lost shipwreck, and the race is on to find it, and who should show up looking for it but Nyx's dangerous family: Big Mama, Jim, and Kratt. Nyx and Zero will face kidnappers, pirates, shipwrecks, warlords, dragons, and maybe a new ally or two on their way to save the day once again.</p> <p>Full cast of narrators includes Jonathan Davis, Houston Mahoney, Kathryn Grody, and Mark Sanderlin.</p>";
