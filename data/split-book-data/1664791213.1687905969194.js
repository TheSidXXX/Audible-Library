Too bad that wasn’t an option.</p> <p>I couldn’t fall for the beautiful slip of a female. The baby sister of my brother’s new mate. She was way too young. Way too human. Still in college. And too bright a force of nature. She had her whole life ahead of her. And I had the Green Berets begging me to re-enlist.</p> <p>My wolf...he wanted her. But if I let her go without claiming her, I might not survive the moon madness.&nbsp;</p>";
