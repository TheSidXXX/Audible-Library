window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From best-selling Kindle Singles author Mishka Shubaly comes <i>Cold Turkey</i>, a step by step roadmap for approaching the harrowing first month of sobriety. Himself 10 years sober, Shubaly addresses the slippery nature of alcoholism, and the messy, anxiety-ridden process of making the decision to stop drinking once and for all.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Shubaly, there is no one-size-fits-all plan. He refutes the notion that the one and only solution for those struggling are 12-step programs and provides a guide for those who want a different approach to getting sober. This is a how-to for those who are serious about taking their lives back, but are ready to define their sobriety on their own terms.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the process, Shubaly exposes - in brutal, up-close, and yes, even absurd and funny detail - what drove him to drink, how he put the bottle down, and the surprising life that awaited him when he did. <i>Cold Turkey</i> real, practical, and intimate advice for those struggling, straight from someone who has really been there. Sure, he understands that for the first three days, you might need to eat all the pizza and all the greasy Chinese food. But he also understands the urgent need to improve your life and habits little by little, day by day. Shubaly, no doubt, becomes the listener’s cheerleader. He wants anyone struggling to succeed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ultimately, the takeaway is very simple; if Shubaly did it, you can too. And more than that, he’ll be right there with you every step of the way.</p>";
