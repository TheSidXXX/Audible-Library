window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the tradition of <i>Kitchen Confidential</i> and <i>Waiter Rant,</i> a rollicking, eye-opening, fantastically indiscreet memoir of a life spent (and misspent) in the hotel industry. </b></p> <p>Jacob Tomsky has worked in hotels for more than a decade, doing everything from valet parking to manning the front desk. He's checked you in, checked you out, separated your white panties from the white bed sheets, parked your car, tasted your room service, cleaned your toilet, denied you a late check out, given you a wake-up call, eaten M&amp;Ms out of your mini-bar, laughed at your jokes, and taken your money. And in <i>Heads in Beds,</i> he pulls back the curtain on the hospitality business, revealing the crazy yet compelling reality of an industry we <i>think</i> we know. It is an incredibly funny, authentic, and irreverent chronicle of the highs and lows of hotel life and boy, is there a market for it: in 2010, the American lodging industry generated $127.7 billion in revenue. Prepare to be amused, shocked, and amazed as he spills the unwritten code of the bellhops, the antics that go on the valet parking garage, and the housekeeping department's dirty little secrets. </p> <p>Prepare to be moved, too, by his insightful honesty about the profession; employees are often poorly paid and frequently abused. However, <i>Heads in Beds</i> is more than just a memoir. Jake explains the secrets of the industry, offering easy and legal ways to get what you need from your hotel without any hassle - from scoring late check-ins and upgrades to getting that pay-per-view charge knocked off your bill. This book will give you the knowledge you need to get the very best service from any hotel or property, from any business that makes its money from putting heads in beds. Or, at the very least, it will keep the bellhops from taking your luggage into the camera-free back office and stomping the crap out of it.</p>";
