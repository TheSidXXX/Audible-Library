window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When there's no way to win, cheat, and cheat big.</b></p> <p>Deep within <i>Heroes of Mythian</i>, a game world where retirees exchange their physical bodies for an eternity of adventure, Howard learns a terrible secret: The game is glitched, and it’s killing its mightiest players forever.&nbsp;</p> <p>Desperate to save his friends and countless innocents, he hatches a plan to fix things. Doing so will require skill, determination, and help from a number of unlikely heroes along the way. Using his deep knowledge of game mechanics, he’ll start again as a level 0 necromancer and exploit his way to power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With luck, his game-breaking exploits will alert <i>Mythian</i>’s admins that something is wrong. With more luck, they’ll pull him aside and ask how and why he'd done it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With even more luck...well...in that unlikely event, the game’s creators - uncaring at best, and sadistic at worst - won’t delete him for exposing their mistakes.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s a risk he’s willing to take, though some warn it may destroy all of <i>Mythian </i>in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Don't miss an epic LitRPG Adventure from number one best-selling author John L. Monk. Did we mention it's got plenty of laughs? It's perfect for fans of Dakota Krout,&nbsp;James Osiris Baldwin, and Ryan Rimmel.</b></p>";
