window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this \"essential\" (</b><b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><b>), \"hilarious\" (</b><b><i>AV Club</i></b><b>) memoir, the star of </b><b><i>Mr. Show</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Breaking Bad</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Better Call Saul</i></b><b> opens up about the highs and lows of showbiz, his cult status as a comedy writer, and what it’s like to reinvent himself as an action film ass-kicker at 50.</b></p> <p><b>“I’ve known Bob Odenkirk for more than 30 years, and yet I had to read this book to believe his stunning career arc.” (Conan O’Brien)</b></p> <p><b>One of the Most Anticipated Books of 2022 - </b><b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><b>,</b><b><i> USA Today</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Parade</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The AV Club</i></b></p> <p>Bob Odenkirk’s career is inexplicable. And yet he will try like hell to explicate it for you. Charting a “Homeric” decades-long “odyssey” from his origins in the seedy comedy clubs of Chicago to a dramatic career full of award nominations - with a side trip into the action-man world that is baffling to all who know him - it’s almost like there are many Bob Odenkirks! But there is just one and one is plenty.</p> <p>Bob embraced a life in comedy after a chance meeting with Second City’s legendary Del Close. He somehow made his way to a job as a writer at <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. While surviving that legendary gauntlet by the skin of his gnashing teeth, he stashed away the secrets of comedy writing - eventually employing them in the immortal “Motivational Speaker” sketch for Chris Farley, honing them on <i>The Ben Stiller Show</i>, and perfecting them on <i>Mr. Show with Bob and David</i>.</p> <p>In Hollywood, Bob demonstrated a bullheadedness that would shame Sisyphus himself, and when all hope was lost for the umpteenth time, the phone rang with an offer to appear on <i>Breaking Bad </i>- a show about how boring it is to be a high school chemistry teacher. His embrace of this strange new world of dramatic acting led him to working with Steven Spielberg, Alexander Payne, and Greta Gerwig, and then, in a twist that will confound you, he re-re-invented himself as a bona fide action star. Why? Listen to this and do your own psychoanalysis - it’s fun!</p> <p>Featuring humorous tangents, wild characters, and Bob’s trademark unflinching drive, <i>Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama</i> is a classic showbiz tale told by a determined idiot.</p>";
