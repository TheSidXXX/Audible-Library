window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Captain Ean Tephe is a man of faith, whose allegiance to his lord and to his ship is uncontested. The Bishopry Militant knows this — and so, when it needs a ship and crew to undertake a secret, sacred mission to a hidden land, Tephe is the captain to whom the task is given. </p> <p>Tephe knows from the start that his mission will be a test of his skill as a leader of men and as a devout follower of his god. It’s what he doesn’t know that matters: to what ends his faith and his ship will ultimately be put — and that the tests he will face will come not only from his god and the Bishopry Militant, but from another, more malevolent source entirely.... </p> <p>Author John Scalzi has ascended to the top ranks of modern science fiction with the best-selling, Hugo-nominated novels <i>Old Man’s War</i> and <i>Zoe’s Tale</i>. Now he tries his hand at fantasy, with a dark and different novella that takes your expectations of what fantasy is and does, and sends them tumbling. </p> <p>Say your prayers... and behold <i>The God Engines</i>.</p>";
