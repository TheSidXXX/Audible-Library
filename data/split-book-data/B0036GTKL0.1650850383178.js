window.bookSummaryJSON = "From the author who brought you the massive <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Bringing Down the House</i>, this is the startling rags-to-riches story of an Italian-American kid from the streets of Brooklyn who claws his way into the wild, frenetic world of the oil exchange. <p> After conquering the hallowed halls of Harvard Business School, he enters the testosterone-laced warrens of the Merc Exchange, the asylumlike oil exchange located in lower Manhattan. A place where billions of dollars trade hands every week, the Merc is like a casino on crack, where former garbagemen become millionaires overnight and where fistfights break out on the trading floor.</p> <p> This ordinary kid has traded Brooklyn for the gold-lined hotel palaces of Dubai. He keeps company on the decks of private yachts in Monte Carlo, teeming with half-naked girls flown in by Saudi sheiks, and makes deals in the dangerous back alleys of Beijing.</p> <p>But the Merc is just a starting place. Taken under the wing of another young gun and partnering with a mysterious young Muslim, the kid embarks on a dangerous adventure to revolutionize the oil trading industry: and, along with it, the world. <i>Rigged</i> is the explicit, exclusive, true story behind the headlines that dominate the world stage.</p>";
