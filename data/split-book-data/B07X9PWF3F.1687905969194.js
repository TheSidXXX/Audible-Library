window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Feared by monsters. </b></p> <p><b>Envied by men. </b></p> <p><b>Craved by women. </b></p> <p>Kaeden is a nomad who lives life on his own terms. He prefers the unbounded steppe over a cramped city, and allegiance to the sword over fealty to a king. When he does make the occasional foray into civilization, it is to procure cold mead, a hot bath, and a good woman. The latter preferably for an hour or less.&nbsp;</p> <p>Life is great, until his wanderings bring him to a forest inhabited by nightmares. There, trapped beneath those lightless eaves, he is forced to ally with a mysterious woman whose cunning and beauty could prove to be his downfall.&nbsp;</p> <p>Either way, one thing is certain: If he is to die, then he will do so covered in the blood of his enemies.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Note:</b> This book contains violent scenes, unconventional thinking, and harem elements.</p>";
