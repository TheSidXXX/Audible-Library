window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tremendous. Tremendously tremendous. Tremendous in its tremendocity. That is how I would describe book four in the Arena series. I say so. Everyone says so. But mostly, I say so.</p> <p>My best friend, Marc Havak, who I hand-picked to represent the planet Earth in an interstellar gladiatorial competition, has kicked-butt and taken names, as I knew he would. Everyone I pick wins. And they win bigly.</p> <p>But this audiobook, wow, this one is amazing. Intense action with yours truly saving the day and telling these alien losers how much they suck? You're hired. Bad-ass space babes who are total hard-body 10s? You're hired. More witty one-liners than a Schwarzenegger flick from the '90s? Hired.</p> <p>What? Youâ€™re still looking at the blurb? Come on. You need to listen to this audiobook right now. For America.</p>";
