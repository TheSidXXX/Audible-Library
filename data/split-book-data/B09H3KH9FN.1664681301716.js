window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Second Edition: Revised for content and additional editing</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>This box set contains all books in the Uniworld Online Trilogy:&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Song Maiden </i></p> <p><i>The Song Mistress </i></p> <p><i>The Song Matron </i></p> <p><b>The skills of a talented and determined Bard are not to be trifled with…</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Cadence was born with a previously unknown disability that prevented her from being able to communicate verbally or through the use of sign language, though it didn’t prevent her from using the written word. Regardless of the challenges she faced through her short life, she persevered and started her first year at college, rooming with her best friend Jill.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, a brutal attack that left her near death caused her to be without a way to easily relay information about her attackers. With no other options available to communicate with others – and with boredom as a result of being confined to a hospital bed having a detrimental effect on her health – Jill came up with a way for her best friend to play a game.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not just any game, however; Uniworld Online was the newest offering from Unitech, a company that designed a new method of fully immersing oneself into a game using a special technology called and NVERS. Set in a fantasy setting with opposing Light and Dark Factions, the immersive virtual reality game is unlike any other the world has ever seen. Having never played a video game before, though, Cadence is subjected to completely unfamiliar territory. Unlike every other player inside Uniworld, she isn’t playing the game to kill monsters and get stronger; instead, she wants to help the citizens of the world (which the other players call NPCs), because that gives her a sense of purpose while her body heals back in the real world.&nbsp;</p> <p>The best thing about Uniworld, however, was that it provided her with something she had never had before: a voice. And with that voice, she has an opportunity to bring justice to her attackers – and maybe even change the landscape of Uniworld in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Contains LitRPG elements such as character progression, quests, skills, stats, and stat sheets. No harems and sparse foul language.</i>&nbsp;</p>";
