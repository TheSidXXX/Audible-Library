window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Boys want attention. Men want respect. Legends just don’t care....</b></p> <p>Nate Temple is finally taking some time off to appreciate the finer things in life...like his new Valkyrie, Kára. But their weeks of romance come to a swift and lethal end when assassins invade the sanctity of Chateau Falco.</p> <p>Not only that, but Nate finds himself neck-deep in politics when he is framed for murdering one of the most notorious Academy justices to ever walk the Earth, and the legendary suits of magical armor belonging to Camelot are suddenly up for grabs.</p> <p>New faces - both good and bad - step into the game, and Nate soon finds himself at the center of a vortex of chaos leading to war in Camelot with the fae queens, on Earth with the Academy wizards, and potentially in Asgard with the Norse pantheon.</p> <p>The more chaotic things get, the more certain Nate becomes that the Masters are finally starting to make their moves out in the open, no longer content to hide in the shadows. They want to force Nate to act....</p> <p>And they might not live to regret his decision to agree.</p> <p>Because only a savage beast of a man could believe that personally kicking off the wars - all at the same time - is the safest course of action. Will he reconsider the wisdom of that decision when it finally brings him face-to-face with one of the Masters - the very person behind all the chaos in the first place?</p> <p>Especially when he learns that this chaos is only the opening move in their grand game of death, and that his foe has been practicing for many, many years for this precise moment. The chance to defeat Nate Temple, once and for all.</p> <p><i>\"Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.\" (Sun Tzu)</i></p> <p><b>If you like Jim Butcher, Kevin Hearne, Steve McHugh, Michael Anderle, Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Shannon Mayer, or K. F. Breene, you won't be able to put down the worldwide best-selling Nate Temple series, or anything else in the Temple Verse.</b></p>";
