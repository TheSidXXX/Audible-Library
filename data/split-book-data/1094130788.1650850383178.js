And that world is in danger.</p> <p>Having decided to betray CASE Global, he can finally reveal his origins to the Enclave and warn them about the company’s imminent invasion. Even if it means alienating Jillaine...and allying with someone he’s always considered his adversary.</p> <p>But war makes for strange bedfellows, and uniting Alissians against such a powerful enemy will require ancient enmities - as well as more recent antagonisms - to be set aside.
