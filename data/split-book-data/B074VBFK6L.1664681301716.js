As his beast demands his rightful place within Acadian Wolves, he's forced to choose between killing his Alpha and leaving New Orleans forever. When a mysterious woman trespasses into the bayou, Jake is instinctively wary of the creature that is not wolf. Inexplicably drawn to her, he attempts to resist her magic as it weaves a seductive spell. As quickly as she appears, the dangerous beauty is kidnapped by a powerful New York vampire, and Jake swears retribution against an old adversary. </p> <p>For centuries Kai Beckett concealed her true identity from those who would steal her ancient powers. Risking everything to save her sister, she searches for the Alpha who'd left San Diego to return to his Cajun roots. Jake, a mate worthy of her spirit, seeks to tame her wild nature, but she is not one to easily submit. As Kai surrenders to her attraction to the Alpha, she embraces her darkest fantasies. </p> <p>From New Orleans to Southern California, Jake and Kai are surrounded by intrigue and danger. Learning to trust each other, they fight lethal enemies and the irresistible connection binding them together. As they spiral into an erotic adventure, will Jake acknowledge Kai as his mate? With a nefarious enemy seeking to capture her, will Jake rise to Alpha, saving both Kai and his pack? </p>";
