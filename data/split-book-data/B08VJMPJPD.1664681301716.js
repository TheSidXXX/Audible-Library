window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The United Eastern States has fallen. Lee Harden and a band of survivors have escaped President Briggs' invasion force. Their only options are to attack Briggs while his forces are delayed on the East Coast...or admit that they've been beaten and go into hiding. For Lee Harden, the decision seems obvious. But as disparate forces, factions, and loyalties begin to converge under the pressure cooker of all-out civil war, Lee is forced to confront not only insurmountable odds, but also the darkest parts of himself that he has left buried in the years since this all began.</p>";
