window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ariel</b></p> <p>I would like to say we were old lovers. That once upon a time he was my everything, and I was his, but that would be a lie. He may have been mine, but I wasn’t his. I was his sister’s annoying little friend who he didn’t even know was in love with him.</p> <p>Years later, after seeing him again for the first time, nothing has changed. Except now, he notices me, and I will do everything in my power to avoid him. Because Falcon is the most conceited man on this planet, and because when he looks at me with steel eyes, my heart still misses a beat.</p> <p><b>Falcon</b></p> <p>I get what I want, and I’m never denied anything either. It’s my charm. It’s hard to say no to something you never knew you desired until I’m standing in front of you. That’s not just who I am, it’s what I do. I help men achieve everything they have ever wanted.</p> <p>Most people would go to great lengths to be near me. Yet, my sweet Ariel, I can’t even get her to stay in the same room as me. Maybe it’s because I told her I would be the best lay of her life - that has to be it - and once I’m finished with her, she’s avoiding being disappointed by every other man for the rest of her life.</p> <p>It couldn’t possibly be anything else, because let’s face it, I’m perfect.</p> <p>All audiobooks in the series can be listened to as stand-alone stories.</p>";
