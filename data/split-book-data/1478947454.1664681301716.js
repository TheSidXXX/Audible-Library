window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Named a Best Book of 2018 by </b><b><i>Fast Company</i></b><b>, this is a \"sharply written and brilliantly reported\" (</b><b><i>Shelf Awareness</i></b><b>) look inside Reddit, the wildly popular, often misunderstood website that has changed the culture of the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Reddit hails itself as \"the front page of the Internet\". It's the third-most visited website in the United States - and yet, millions of Americans have no idea what it is.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>We Are the Nerds</i> is an engrossing look deep inside this captivating, maddening enterprise, whose army of obsessed users have been credited with everything from solving cold-case crimes and spurring tens of millions of dollars in charitable donations to seeding alt-right fury and landing Donald Trump in the White House. <i>We Are the Nerds</i> is a gripping start-up narrative: the story of how Reddit's founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, rose up from their suburban childhoods to become millionaires and create an icon of the digital age - before seeing the site engulfed in controversies and nearly losing control of it for good.&nbsp;</p> <p>Based on Christine Lagorio-Chafkin's exclusive access to founders Ohanian and Huffman, <i>We Are the Nerds</i> is also a compelling exploration of the way we all communicate today - and how we got here. Reddit and its users have become a mirror of the Internet: it has dingy corners, shiny memes, malicious trolls, and a sometimes heart-melting ability to connect people across cultures, oceans, and ideological divides.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
