window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A heart-wrenching yet hopeful memoir of a young marriage that is redefined by mental illness and affirms the power of love. </p> <p>Mark and Giulia's life together began as a storybook romance. They fell in love at 18, married at 24, and were living their dream life in San Francisco. When Giulia was 27, she suffered a terrifying and unexpected psychotic break that landed her in the psych ward for nearly a month. One day she was vibrant and well adjusted; the next she was delusional and suicidal, convinced that her loved ones were not safe. </p> <p>Eventually Giulia fully recovered, and the couple had a son. But soon after Jonas was born, Giulia had another breakdown, and then a third a few years after that. Pushed to the edge of the abyss, everything the couple had once taken for granted was upended. </p> <p>A story of the fragility of the mind and the tenacity of the human spirit, <i>My Lovely Wife in the Psych Ward</i> is, above all, a love story that raises profound questions: How do we care for the people we love? What and whom do we live for? Breathtaking in its candor, radiant with compassion, and written with dazzling lyricism, Lukach's is an intensely personal odyssey through the harrowing years of his wife's mental illness, anchored by an abiding devotion to family that will affirm listeners' faith in the power of love. </p>";
