As she and her crew prepare to become the first humans to travel outside our solar system, a string of assassination attempts lead them to an unlikely mystery.</p> <p>Rejoin Captain Omandi, Misha Sokolov, James Branson, Linnea Sorenson, along with new and returning members of <i>Bladerunner</i>’s crew, as they unleash Omandi’s Daemon in service to uncovering what might be the most heinous crime ever perpetrated on sentient life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Omandi leadership and faith will be tested like never before as she guides her team to a critical decision. Do they submit to a seemingly unlimited galactic power and secure Earth’s future, or do they risk everything and fulfill humanity’s promise?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Includes a special note from the author. </b>&nbsp;</p>";
