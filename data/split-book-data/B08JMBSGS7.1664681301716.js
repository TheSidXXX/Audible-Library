Surely nothing will go wrong.</b></p> <p>Artorian shrugged off moonfall and war like it was a gentle rain and must now face new trials. Specifically: life in the world created by the Dungeon Core, Cal. Unfortunately, Cal has only put together the most bare-bones of systems.</p> <p>He's no stranger to solving near impossible problems; how difficult could it be to smooth out the slew of angry Mages with bitter rivalries, uncountable hidden secrets, a complete inability to cultivate, and a Dungeon creating messes at full speed? One way or another, it is up to Artorian to pick up the pieces. Heâ€™s ready to roll up his sleeves and administrate.</p> <p>There are some very serious holes in this world, and the old academic is determined to fix them.</p>";
