window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Whether you’re a sunling or an earthling, growing up isn’t easy. Shy nine-year-old Gustafer Yellowgold has to grapple with neighborhood bullies, an over-achieving brother, and parental expectations just like kids on Earth do. He would rather lose himself in comic books and dream the day away than make deliveries for his father’s raisin-butchering business after school. Fateful events put Gustafer at his ultimate crossroad when he sees a darker opportunity to control his own destiny on the Sun.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two-time Grammy nominee Morgan Taylor has long been a hit equally with ever-hip parents and kids on the family circuit with his smart and catchy multimedia concerts. At last, he gets to tell the full backstory of his creation, Gustafer. Featuring 13 brand new songs and fresh recordings of three fan favorites, all produced by Pat Sansone of <b>Wilco</b>, this captivating Audible Original is great for family listening as well as for kids ages six and up to discover and enjoy on their own. Besides hours of delightful storytelling and music, listeners will take away some mildly revolutionary life lessons: Be yourself, no matter what your age, and don’t be afraid to take your own path.&nbsp;</p> <p>Enjoy a special bonus in Chapter 14, with an exclusive full album of the songs featured in <i>I’m from the Sun</i>. You will also get a free PDF download including key character art and scenes from the hand of Morgan Taylor, and a complete lyric compendium too! Only from Audible.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
