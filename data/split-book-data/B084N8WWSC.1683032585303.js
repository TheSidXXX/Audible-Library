window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Billy Kelly's <i>This Is a Family Show!</i> is a stand-up comedy experience (with music) that parents and kids can enjoy together. From jokes about nocturnal animals and microwaves to Ben Franklin and people throwing turtles, the whole family will laugh along while listening to this comedian’s unique perspectives. It’s comedy toast with the crust cut off. Who needs all that crusty talk about dating, politics, and money, anyway?&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the first two decades of his career, Grammy-nominated family entertainer Billy Kelly has opened for President Barack Obama, duetted with Davy Jones of The Monkees, and released a critically acclaimed family-friendly, stand-up comedy album - in that order. Billy loves making people laugh and doesn’t see why kids can’t be in on the fun.&nbsp;</p> <p>“An endearingly oddball sense of humor.” (National Public Radio)&nbsp;</p> <p>“Stand-up that some have found offensively clean.” (<i>The New York Times</i>)</p>";
