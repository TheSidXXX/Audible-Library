If you're prepared to take the risk.</p> <p>To face down this threat the Time Police will despatch their toughest undercover agents. Which is fine until the unthinkable happens. Replacements are needed fast, and who better than three young officers who don't even look the part?</p> <p>Step forward Jane, Luke and Matthew. They may be about to graduate, but there's still plenty of time for everything to go wrong. Throw in the Versailles time slip, a covert jump to ancient Egypt and a race against time itself and you've got yourself an assignment worthy of Team Weird.</p>";
