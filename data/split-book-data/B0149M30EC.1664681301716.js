window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>New York Times</i> best seller by the author of <i>The Bone Clocks</i> and <i>Cloud Atlas</i></p> <p>Named one of the best books of the year by <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, NPR, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Telegraph</i>, <i>National Post</i>, <i>BookPage</i>, and <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>Keep your eyes peeled for a small black iron door.&nbsp;</p> <p>Down the road from a working-class British pub, along the brick wall of a narrow alley, if the conditions are exactly right, you'll find the entrance to Slade House. A stranger will greet you by name and invite you inside. At first, you won't want to leave. Later, you'll find that you can't. Every nine years, the house's residents - an odd brother and sister - extend a unique invitation to someone who's different or lonely: a precocious teenager, a recently divorced policeman, a shy college student. But what really goes on inside Slade House? For those who find out, it's already too late....&nbsp;</p> <p>Spanning five decades, from the last days of the 1970s to the present, leaping genres, and barreling toward an astonishing conclusion, this intricately woven novel will pull you into a reality-warping new vision of the haunted house story - as only David Mitchell could imagine it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Praise for <i>Slade House</i></p> <p>“A fiendish delight... Mitchell is something of a magician.” (<i>The Washington Post</i>)</p> <p>“Entertainingly eerie... We turn to [Mitchell] for brain-tickling puzzle palaces, for character studies and for language.” (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</p> <p>“A ripping yarn... Like Shirley Jackson’s Hill House or the Overlook Hotel from Stephen King’s <i>The Shining</i>, [<i>Slade House</i>] is a thin sliver of hell designed to entrap the unwary.... As the Mitchellverse grows ever more expansive and connected, this short but powerful novel hints at still more marvels to come.” (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>)</p> <p>“Like Stephen King in a fever...manically ingenious.” (<i>The Guardian</i> [UK])</p> <p>“A haunted house story that savors of Dickens, Stephen King, J. K. Rowling and H. P. Lovecraft, but possesses more psychic voltage than any of them.” (<i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>)</p> <p>“Tightly crafted and suspenseful yet warmly human...the ultimate spooky nursery tale for adults.” (<i>The Huffington Post</i>)</p>";
