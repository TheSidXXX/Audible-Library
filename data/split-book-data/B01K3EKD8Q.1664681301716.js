His chops from 30 years with the LAPD speak for themselves. </p> <p>Soon one of Southern California's biggest moguls comes calling. The reclusive billionaire has less than six months to live and a lifetime of regrets. He hires Bosch to find out whether he has an heir. Using all of his cold-case skills, Bosch pieces together a 65-year-old mystery and finds out that the case is not as simple - or as cold - as he thought. </p> <p>Swift, unpredictable, and thrilling, <i>The Wrong Side of Goodbye</i> proves once again that \"Connelly is still very much in his prime\" (<i>Washington Post</i>). </p>";
