Performed as a 1930s radio drama, itâ€™s bursting with humor for all ages, orchestral scoring, and some of the most talented voices on Broadway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When their ace pilot parents (and adorable puppy) mysteriously disappear over the Pacific, the Flamingo Sisters - Flo, Faye, and Franny - escape the clutches of their evil Uncle Freidrich (who believes girls should <i>never </i>pilot aeroplanes) and join a flying circus. They soon become a smashing sensation, performing aerial acrobatics, wing walking, and other death-defying feats in a dazzling biplane outfitted with three cockpits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But when the girls discover a mysterious map - which may lead them to the long-lost Flamingo family fortune - their dastardly uncle follows them on a thrilling chase in the skies. <i>The Flying Flamingo Sisters</i> must use wits, courage and derring - do to solve secret codes, trek through spooky jungles, and save their parents.
