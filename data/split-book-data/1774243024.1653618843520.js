window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There isn't much time left for Lucian North to save his brother.</b></p> <p>Discovering a new way to grow exponentially stronger, Lucian forms an unsteady alliance with the angel Danira, one that he hopes could grow into something more.</p> <p>Matters are complicated once Lucian is given a deadline by the Council of Death: produce his predecessor, who has mysteriously disappeared, or be tortured until he relinquishes his mantle.</p> <p>Hunted by parasites, injuresouls, fallen angels, and now his own kind, Lucian must level up in a way he's never fathomed before, crafting everything from mechas to bone armor designed to withstand even the strongest attack. He must forge new alliances, realize the impermanence of the alliances he already has made, and even become a Death Hunter if he hopes to save his brother from certain doom.</p> <p>But that's not all that's at stake.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Lucian grows closer to his goal, he's blindsided by an attack that he never saw coming. He's also asked to do something that will reignite a war between the Progeny of Light and the Progeny of Darkness.</p> <p>The decision Lucian makes will have grave consequences for his future, and that's before his final discovery, one that threatens the very existence of his family.</p> <p>It's going to be an uphill battle from start to finish. And while Lucian is always up to the challenge, he may not be ready for the consequences.</p> <p><i>Death's Mantle</i> is a dark fantasy GameLit series that LitRPG, metaphysical fantasy, occult sci-fi, and thriller listeners will love. <i>Death's Mantle</i> is written by Harmon Cooper, best-selling GameLit author of <i>Way of the Immortals</i>, <i>House of Dolls</i>, <i>Cherry Blossom Girls</i>, <i>The Feedback Loop</i>, and <i>Monster Hunt NYC</i>.
