Hundreds of warships have begun to overwhelm the Confederacy, and we don't have nearly enough magic or ships to defend every world.</p> <p>Our only real hope is resurrecting the Vagrant Fleet. We have the Spellship, and our demon allies control the Earthmother's Bulwark. I'm the captain of the Word of Xal, our most powerful offensive ship in the fleet. We're strong, but Necrotis is stronger, and the gap is growing.</p> <p>If I'm going to keep my people alive I need to be able to fire the Word's main spellcannon. I need to be able to deliver the kill shot against Necrotis. I need to become an Eradicator.</p> <p>I've been invited to train with the Ifrit on the world Nebiat, deep in Krox territory. Every day I spend mastering destruction magic more Confederate worlds fall. They're counting on me. I will not let them down.</p> <p>A new series in the Amazon best-selling Magitech Chronicles universe. Want to make your own characters?
