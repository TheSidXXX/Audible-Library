window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Malem has joined the forces of good and wages war against the vast host of Vorgon, the Balor who has come to destroy the world. Malem has four beautiful women fighting at his side, one of them a former general of Vorgon's army - a night elf tamed by his unique skill. He also has a few hill giants and other monsters ready to follow him to the gates of hell itself.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it's not enough. The army of Vorgon stands poised to defeat the defenders. Despite Malem's powers and the unique magic and abilities his lovely companions bring to the table, the enemy has the advantage when it comes to sheer numbers: Vorgon's host stretches from horizon to horizon as far as the eye can see, painting the fields black.&nbsp;</p> <p>Worst of all, he's still hunted by the Darkness: a curse laid upon him by Vorgon's predecessor. Its ghostly hands are always trying to drag him down to the underworld at the worst of times.</p> <p>He's been running from the Darkness his entire life.</p> <p>But now, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance, that running must stop.</p> <p>It's time to stand and fight. It's time to face the Darkness. And save the world.</p> <p>Note: This book contains harem elements.</p>";
