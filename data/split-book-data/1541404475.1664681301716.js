window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Montana's new life in Vuldranni, the medieval fantasy game world he lucked into, isn't quite the tranquil extended fishing trip he'd been hoping for. But you gotta admit, he's doing pretty well for himself. Now he's Montana Coggeshall, heir to a dukedom. If he can get his crew to Osterstadt and claim it in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Heir Today, Pawn Tomorrow</i> is a heart-pounding adventure through uncharted territory. Montana and the party must cross WarWaters, a lake that offers everything but a pleasure cruise, and then race through a dense, forbidden forest full of hungry beasts, unfriendly races, and a few cocky nobles. If you're ready for an epic quest full of hellbeasts, ghost royals, and wyrm guts, this is the book for you.</p>";
