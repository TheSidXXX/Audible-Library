Here, you will find laughter. Here, a quartermaster must discover why the human insists that the mass produced broom, identical down to the molecule to every other broom on the base, is the \"wrong\" broom, and why and how they expect him to fix it. Here, aliens learn the meaning of \"enough C4\". Here, a medic meets the challenge of understanding why a human thinks it can survive on chocolate cake. Here, Monty Python meets <i>Star Trek</i>.</p>";
