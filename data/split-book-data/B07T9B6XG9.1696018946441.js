Where they are taught about their abilities, and how to function in the human world. Maddison already has the human part down, but this supernatural thing is an entirely new dangerous game.</p> <p>Example one: mean girls who can actually turn you into a frog.</p> <p>Example two: Asher Lock, a god at the Academy.
