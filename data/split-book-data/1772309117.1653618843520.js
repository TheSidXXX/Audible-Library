window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It doesn’t take a legendary sword to make a legendary swordsman, but it certainly helps.</p> <p>Keras Selyrian is already well on the way to cutting his name into the annals of legend. He’s fought false divinities, thieving sorcerers, and corrupt demigods - and left them defeated in his wake.</p> <p>But he’s a long way from home, and Kaldwyn offers a different brand of danger than he’s used to. He’s already got a sword of unfathomable power, but it’s damaged and leaking world-annihilating mana, so he’s in the market for a new one. Possibly six. The more the better, really.</p> <p>The Six Sacred Swords are Kaldwyn’s most famous artifacts, forged as the only means to defeat the god beasts. Each sword must be earned by a worthy champion, and no single person has ever managed to collect them all.</p> <p>Not yet, at least. Keras is just getting started.</p> <p><i>Six Sacred Swords</i> is a lighthearted fantasy adventure inspired by Japanese game series like <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, <i>Final Fantasy</i>, and <i>Fire Emblem</i>. It takes place in the same universe as the Arcane Ascension novels, but years earlier and with a different protagonist. While the books are interconnected, they can be listened to on their own in any order.</p> <p>For appendices with further details on the magic and characters, please download the supplementary PDF.</p>";
