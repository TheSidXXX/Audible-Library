window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Zundy has always been different. As a pal-tee, a distant cousin to the dwarves, he, and all others of his race, absorb traits from the very first item they touch upon birth. Instead of absorbing the essence of stone, or steel, like most others in his town, Zundy accidentally absorbed those of a beetle. Those who are different are often treated poorly, and for Zundy, this was no exception.</p> <p>His time in the small town is coming to an end, though. The Great Journey, the time when all pal-tee youths of age set out in search of their race's most valued treasure, is upon them. Beyond his small town, Zundy will discover a world far grander and fantastic than he ever could have imagined.</p> <p>Travel to the Green Sea, the last know sighting of the Viridian Core will be far from easy. Before he can even lay eyes on the sprawling ocean, Zundy will first need to pass through the Giantlands, and with powerful Guardians blocking his path, the task seems impossible. Zundy was never one to give up and quit though, and to him, there is no greater thrill than facing a challenge and coming out the victor.</p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains GameLit elements, such as stats sheets, a form of leveling and experience gain.</b></p>";
