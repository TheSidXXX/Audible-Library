window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><b> Top 10 Crime Novel of the Year </b></p> <p><b>From the best-selling and award-winning master of suspense, the first novel in a thrilling new series, introducing Colter Shaw.</b></p> <p><i>\"You have been abandoned.\"</i></p> <p>A young woman has gone missing in Silicon Valley, and her father has hired Colter Shaw to find her. The son of a survivalist family, Shaw is an expert tracker. Now, he makes a living as a \"reward seeker\", traveling the country to help police solve crimes and private citizens locate missing persons. But what seems a simple investigation quickly thrusts him into the dark heart of America's tech hub and the cutthroat billion-dollar video-gaming industry.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>\"Escape if you can.\"</i></p> <p>When another victim is kidnapped, the clues point to one video game with a troubled past - <i>The Whispering Man</i>. In that game, the player has to survive after being abandoned in an inhospitable setting with five random objects. Is a madman bringing the game to life?</p> <p><i>\"Or die with dignity.\"</i></p> <p>Shaw finds himself caught in a cat and mouse game, risking his own life to save the victims even as he pursues the kidnapper across both Silicon Valley and the dark net. Encountering eccentric game designers, trigger-happy gamers, and ruthless tech titans, he soon learns he isn't the only one on the hunt: Someone is on his trail and closing fast.</p> <p><i>The Never Game</i> proves once more why \"Deaver is a genius when it comes to manipulation and deception\" (Associated Press).</p>";
