window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Drew Hayes, and for the past six years I've made my living as a writer. In that time, I've published 20 books, written hundreds of thousands of words, and made countless mistakes - most of which I like to think I've learned from.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Underqualified Advice (and Other Amusing Diversions)</i> is my attempt to compile those lessons and share them with others, as well as have some fun along the way. Half of the book is dedicated to detailing specifics about writing, maneuvering the industry, and keeping fiscally afloat in largely unstable waters. The other half, however, is dedicated to pure fun: essays on extremely specific topics, flash fiction, and some bits that not even I know how to classify.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Even if you don't particularly need the advice, we could all use an amusing diversion from time to time.</p>";
