And all you have to do is to find, reproduce, and report bugs before the last pixel is locked in and the games are launched to an eager public. Sure, there’s the unpaid overtime, the office politics, and the ever-present threat of layoffs. But you get to game!</p> <p>But when a small third-party testing team is assigned to work on<i> Blade Skill Online - </i>a highly anticipated virtual reality MMORPG - they quickly find that some bugs are more serious than others, and some truly insidious features are \"working as intended\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>If our intrepid QA team wants to survive the launch cycle, they're going to have to break this game. Hard.</p>";
