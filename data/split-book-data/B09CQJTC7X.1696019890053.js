window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jeff the Game Master is a Level One player...Wait, what?</b></p> <p>After the rogue patch did its damage, Jeff and the rest of Infinite World’s players face a new threat: Shelarag, the Mother of Dragons. Well, there was a father; what did you expect? She’s pissed. Someone killed her lover, and now they will pay.</p> <p>Still tasked with figuring out who or what is responsible for the chaos, Jeff must also figure out what the heck a Manipulator Class is. To help him on this journey, former GMs Torvi and Snapdragon will apply their extensive knowledge of the game to power-level Jeff and attempt to restore normalcy to the game.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dak, Jeweliette, Oliver, and the rest of the party find themselves stuck in the next questline to destroy dragon after dragon after dragon...after dragon. Maybe Dan Shaklee should just pull the plug already...</p> <p><i>Manipulating Magic </i>is book two of the Jeff the Game Master series. It picks up where the first left off, and his exploits are only half the fun. Experience a unique spin on the LitRPG genre, not just providing the perspective of the players, but also of one of those mystical, magical, all-powerful GMs we all dream of being.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
