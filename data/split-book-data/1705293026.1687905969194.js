window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A groundbreaking argument about the link between autism and ingenuity. </b></p> <p>Why can humans alone invent? In <i>The Pattern Seekers</i>, Cambridge University psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen makes a case that autism is as crucial to our creative and cultural history as the mastery of fire. Indeed, Baron-Cohen argues that autistic people have played a key role in human progress for 70,000 years, from the first tools to the digital revolution.&nbsp;</p> <p>How? Because the same genes that cause autism enable the pattern seeking that is essential to our species' inventiveness. However, these abilities exact a great cost on autistic people, including social and often medical challenges, so Baron-Cohen calls on us to support and celebrate autistic people in both their disabilities and their triumphs. Ultimately, <i>The Pattern Seekers</i> isn't just a new theory of human civilization, but a call to consider anew how society treats those who think differently.</p>";
