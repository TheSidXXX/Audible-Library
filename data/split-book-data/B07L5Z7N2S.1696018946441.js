Clarke Awards.</b></p> <p>\"Absolutely wonderful...utterly brilliant.\" (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)</p> <p>For centuries, the kingdom of Iraden has been protected by the god known as the Raven. He watches over his territory from atop a tower in the powerful port of Vastai. His will is enacted through the Raven's Lease, a human ruler chosen by the god himself. His magic is sustained via the blood sacrifice that every Lease must offer. And under the Raven's watch, the city flourishes.</p> <p>But the power of the Raven is weakening. A usurper has claimed the throne. The kingdom borders are tested by invaders who long for the prosperity that Vastai boasts. And they have made their own alliances with other gods.</p> <p>It is into this unrest that the warrior Eolo - aide to Mawat, the true Lease - arrives. And in seeking to help Mawat reclaim his city, Eolo discovers that the Raven's Tower holds a secret. Its foundations conceal a dark history that has been waiting to reveal itself...and to set in motion a chain of events that could destroy Iraden forever.</p> <p>\"It's a delight to read something so different, so wonderful and strange.\" (Patrick Rothfuss)</p> <p>For more Ann Leckie, check out:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Ancillary Justice</i></li> <li><i>Ancillary Sword</i></li> <li><i>Ancillary Mercy</i></li> <li><i>Provenance </i></li> </ul>";
