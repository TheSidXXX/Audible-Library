Born to the Clan of the Hawk of the nomadic Shin'a'in people, she saw her entire clan slain by brigands. Vowing blood revenge upon the murderers, she became one of the sword-sworn, the most elite of all warriors. Trained in all the forms of death-dealing combat, she took to the road in search of her enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>She was Kethry. Born to a noble house, sold into a hateful \"marriage\", she fled life's harshness for the sanctuary of the White Winds, a powerful school of sorcery.

And when she became the bearer of a uniquely magical sword that drew her to those in need, Kethry was led to a fateful meeting with Tarma.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>United by sword-spell and the will of the goddess, Tarma and Kethry swore a blood oath to carry on their mutual fight against evil. And together, sword master and sorceress set forth to fulfill their destiny....</p>";
