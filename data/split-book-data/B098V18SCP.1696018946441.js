window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sell-spell sorcerers, vampire operatives, killer automatons, and a heist to nab a legendary dragon stone.... It's all in a day's work for Davrick Caliburn.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>A bounty hunter with a price on his head, Davrick Caliburn must evade the sorcerous reach of the Grand Imperium. Never mind the fact that his new employer is a vampiric blood-baroness - she's promised him a pocket full of coins and a one-way ticket to freedom. The only problem: That \"ticket\" is aboard an Imperium battle-train. Between the armored automatons, elite enemy troops, and the fiendish sorcerer who leads them, Davrick can only wonder what kind of a mess he's gotten himself into.&nbsp;</p> <p>This audiobook brings together all six novellas in the Siege Chronicles series, recounting the high-flying, gun-blazing, spell-blasting adventures of Davrick Caliburn and his misfit mercenary team. Each book is novella-length (three to four hours), but together the stories make up a single, continuous narrative. Please note: These are steampunk action-adventures, set in a secondary fantasy world embroiled in war, and contain fast-paced action and fighting throughout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Book 1: <i>Battle-Train Siege</i>&nbsp;</li> <li>Book 2: <i>Mercenary Siege</i>&nbsp;</li> <li>Book 3: <i>Gearmeister Siege</i>&nbsp;</li> <li>Book 4: <i>Aircruiser Siege</i>&nbsp;</li> <li>Book 5: <i>Blood Mountain Siege</i>&nbsp;</li> <li>Book 6: <i>Demon Realm Siege</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Print and e-book editions are also available in a single omnibus edition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
