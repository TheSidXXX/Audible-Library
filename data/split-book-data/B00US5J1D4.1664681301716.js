Ariely applies this scientific analysis of the human condition in his \"Ask Ariely\" Q and A column in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, in which he responds to readers who write in with personal conundrums ranging from the serious to the curious: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>What can you do to stay calm when you're playing the volatile stock market? </li> <li>What's the best way to get someone to stop smoking? </li> <li>How can you maximize the return on your investment at an all-you-can-eat buffet? </li> <li>Is it possible to put a price on the human soul? </li> <li>Can you ever rationally justify spending thousands of dollars on a Rolex? </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>In <i>Ask Ariely</i> a broad variety of economic, ethical, and emotional dilemmas are explored and addressed through text and images.
