It turns out, they were right.&nbsp;</p> <p>Breed saved a world, killed a demon, destroyed the gods that made it and then went home. It was time to rest, perchance to die. But as any fool knows, there is no rest for the wicked. No one is going anywhere until an old friend is dead, an old enemy is saved and hot or cold vengeance is served. The battle is over, now the war has begun.</p>";
