window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jace Warin never wanted anything more than to attend the School of Swords and Serpents to escape the labor camps and restore his family's stained honor.</b></p> <p>But the determined young martial artist soon discovers the school he's always dreamed about is teeming with secret plots and sinister designs. To survive, he will have to master long-lost jinsei techniques, repair his wounded soul, and face down a most unexpected enemy: The Academy's ruthless headmaster and cunning professors.</p> <p><i>Hollow Core </i>is the first book in the School of Swords and Serpents series, a tale of wuxia adventure, cultivation mastery, and lurking threats.</p> <p>“Wow, this book is crazy-good. If the Harry Potter series were somehow violently smashed together with the characters from Mortal Kombat, you might have something that comes close to the School of Swords and Serpents.” (James A. Hunter, best-selling author of<i> Rogue Dungeon</i>, <i>Bibliomancer</i>, and the LitRPG epic <i>Viridian Gate Online</i>)</p>";
