What she finds is a primitive xenobot, Eno, who takes her on a mind-bending trip through time that begins as the Berlin Wall is falling, and takes her back to the origins of the modern internet and the fall of a digital Atlantis created by her father, Wesley Park, and entrepreneur William Ackerson.</p> <p><i>A New Reality</i> expands Stan Lee’s final science fiction universe in new and unexpected ways, exploring the early global computing boom of the 1990s through the eyes of two well-meaning visionaries whose innovations introduce the world to the promise, power, and perils of connectivity - and whose original sins could destroy it all.&nbsp;</p>";
