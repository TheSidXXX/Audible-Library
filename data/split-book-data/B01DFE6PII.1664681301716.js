Throughout the centuries, Micah ben Judah has shouldered the burden of keeping legions of unnatural creatures in check, but no more.</p> <p>The time has come for Raphael to renew the Sentinelâ€™s power in another. He has found that successor in current day Atlanta.</p> <p>Kellan Thorne never thought he would ever have an angel come knocking. Sarcastic, irreverent, and prone to fits of profanity, Kellan is more at home making obscure references to Doctor Who and Star Wars than religious introspection.</p> <p>His life will change forever as the veil between worlds is torn free and he is placed at the center of a war of angels and demons in which he may be the biggest prize. Kellan must accept the power and burden of his own free will, but can Micah and Raphael keep him alive long enough to decide?</p>";
