But the knightmare knows a terrible secret: Ruma is a murderer out to spread corrupted magic throughout their island nation. He’s already killed a population of phoenixes and he intends to kill even more.</p> <p>In order to protect his home, his adopted sister, and the girl he admires from afar, Volke will need to confront his hero, the Master Arcanist Gregory Ruma.</p> <p>A fast-paced flintlock fantasy for those who enjoy <i>How to Train Your Dragon</i> by Cressida Cowell, <i>Unsouled</i> (Cradle Series) by Will Wight, and Percy Jackson and the <i>Olympians</i> by Rick Riordan.</p>";
