window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I spent most of my life trying to get by with whatever happiness I could, that included alcohol, food, and porn.&nbsp;</p> <p>My death was unpleasant and humiliating. However, death is something we all need to go through. A bit like a proctology exam: necessary, but never anything one wants to go through while it's happening.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, death was supposed to be the end of it. Either way, the pain, suffering, and failures were supposed to be over. I was supposed to wink out, or perhaps take a trip to a lovely afterlife!&nbsp;</p> <p>No, I ended up as a small stone, strapped to a table, while a pimple-faced teenager rubbed my facets and told me how \"lovely\" I was. Last time I checked, birth wasn't supposed to be as embarrassing as death!&nbsp;</p> <p>Life as a dungeon core isn't all bad. I like watching lizard love triangles and snooping on militaristic dwarves - though there is that issue where I'm trying to free myself from the entanglements of the Gods...OK, yeah, that last one is a bit of a problem.</p>";
