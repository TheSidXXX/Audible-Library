window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The dwarves are going to battle for the last time.</p> <p>There has been no word from the courageous warrior Tungdil since the bitter struggle at the Black Abyss. Dragons, magicians, and the cruel Ã¤lfar have advanced far into the kingdom Girdlegard, ruthlessly seizing vast areas of land. It seems that the dwarves are facing their next battle with very little hope of survival.</p> <p>But then the inexplicable happens; a dwarf warrior dressed in black armor returns from the abyss - with a formidable army in tow. This warrior calls himself Tungdil, and for his most loyal friend Ireheart and his allies, this means a new hope. But soon doubts begin arise....

It is a question of the future of Girdlegard - and the future of all the dwarves.</p> <p>In the final installment of this spectacular fantasy epic, the greatest of the dwarves' adventures begins....</p>";
