window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the award-winning author of </b><b><i>Sentinels of Creation</i></b><b> comes a near-future science-fiction series that promises to thrill fans of the Expanse, Bladerunner, and Ready Player One. </b><b><i>Paradigm 2045: Trinity's Children</i></b><b> serves up an adventurous bounty of first contact, genetic engineering, and artificial intelligence while providing a reverential nod to golden age masters such as Robert A. Heinlein and Larry Niven.</b></p> <p><b>In 2004, Doctor Damien Howard's 131st birthday celebration took an unexpected turn. His personal SETI project detected an extraterrestrial signal directed at Earth.</b></p> <p>Unfortunately, Dr. Howard's long-hoped-for communication contained a message of dire warning rather than greeting. In 1945, humanity had become a species of galactic interest and was given 100 years to address the issue.</p> <p>Now in 2045, only months remain before humanity's grace period expires and the world mourns the passing of a titan. Damien Howard lies dead. Only his security officer, Misha Sokolov and artificially intelligent Agent Coleman are aware of Earth's impending deadline.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Nairobi, Kenya, Charlotte Omandi prepares to address luminaries gathered for her keynote presentation at the Omandi Institute. Her life changes forever when Damien Howard reaches out to her from beyond the grave. She is the first born of Howard’s Children, nine genetically enhanced humans who hold the key to Earth’s salvation.</p> <p>Charlotte must assemble a crew capable of demonstrating both faster-than-light travel and the wisdom required to join a galactic community. As humanity's leaders become aware of the impending threat, massive forces attempt to impede Omandi and her nascent crew.</p> <p>Despite Damien's gifts of wealth, technology, and genetic superiority, his children face daunting challenges as they race against an Armageddon clock set to strike on July 16, 2045. By that day, humanity will either shift its paradigm or perish.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
