Since I could use a fresh start, he offers me a place to stay with a buddy of his.</p> <p>At the bachelorette party, a raunchy game results in a quest to find me a one-night stand. When a hunk with dark blue eyes and perfect bone structure hits me with a silly line at the bar, my mission is complete. I vow to move on from our steamy night as I head to the rehearsal dinner, certain one of my brother's hot pro football player groomsmen will be my Prince Charming.</p> <p>Then the best man turns around. Dark blue eyes. Perfect bone structure. A body I won't soon forget. And apparently my new roommate.</p>";
