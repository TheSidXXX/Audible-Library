window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Laugh-out-loud funny, crude, and always unpredictable - Mike Baron delivers book three in the Florida Man series.</b></p> <p>As Gary and Krystal drag Prince Larry and Princess Regan through the mud, a snapping turtle latches on to the prince’s manhood and a debate breaks out on whether to release the video.</p> <p><i>Will it help or hurt the Royal Ducats?</i></p> <p>Gary brawls with a man in a bunny suit at Wacky World. Venezuelans use Gary’s property for drug deals. Legendary dadaist Claude Balls stuns the world with his creations. Leotis, a giant Mekong catfish, becomes Gary’s friend and advisor, but only Gary can see the painfully shy Leotis - perhaps it was that cane toad Gary licked. Krystal trains to fight Lucha Libre sensation Javelina.</p>";
