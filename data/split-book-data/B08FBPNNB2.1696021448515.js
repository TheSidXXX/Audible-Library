window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One man dominates Avila</b><br> <b>Another must take him down or die.</b></p> <p>Bilda <i>FOH </i>Smartown has the biggest civilization in Avila. He brings in billions in ad revenue. Everything is branded. For instance, you can partake of a foamy ale in the Troll and Tourniquet pub - sponsored by Texatron Auto-air, the cheapest deals on the best air cars - or pull the lever at the High Summer Hangings - courtesy of Blue Bird Neon. Perhaps you’d like to sponsor a battle and ride with the fiercest centaurs, or hire a bard and seduce a princess. Everything and anything has a price tag in Bilda’s empire. Revenue is king, and coincidently, so is Bilda.</p> <p>So when Bilda demands his agents take a cut in their percentage, it’s not well received. Especially since they made him what he is.</p> <p>A bet is made.</p> <p>A plan is hatched.</p> <p>Now one man is tasked with building a civilization from nothing, one that must rival Bilda’s, or he’ll be thrown back to the slums he came from, where he’s not particularly welcome, to put it mildly.</p> <p>Oh, and he’s got six months to do it!</p> <p>If you’ve ever wondered what would happen when LitRPG and<i> Trading Places</i> meet, then you’re a little odd, but the answer is <i>4X Four Hex</i>.</p> <p>Mild cursing - No frolicking - but…</p> <p><b>Turn based fighting!</b></p> <p>Yes, you heard it right. <i>4X Four Hex</i> brings turn based fighting to your listening device. Experience the true horror of what it’s like to stand there and wait for your opponent’s strike!</p>";
