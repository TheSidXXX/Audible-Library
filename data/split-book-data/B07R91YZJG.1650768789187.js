Now, before we talk about how fantastic I am at making world leader decisions, let’s talk about how great this sequel is.</p> <p>I've read many sequels, and all were bad. Very very bad. But this one? It's the best. And not just because I'm in it. No. Well, yes. I’m in it, and I always do a fantastic job with everything. But it’s also because Marc kicks a ton more alien ass, bangs a ton more alien babes, and generally shows the universe why Americans are the ones who always save the world.</p>";
