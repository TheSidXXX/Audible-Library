window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new, sexy stand-alone from </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling authors Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward.</b></p> <p>It all started with a bet.</p> <p>When my young son inherited half of his great grandfather’s historic inn, I decided to move us both to the place where I grew up.</p> <p>Notice I said <i>half</i> of the Inn. The other half now belonged to Levi Miller, the famous quarterback who had other ideas about what we should do with the property.</p> <p>We won’t mention that I accidentally injured him during our first meeting, causing him to get eight stitches.</p> <p>You could say we got off on the wrong foot.</p> <p>We bickered a lot as we both moved into the property while we figured things out.</p> <p>He wanted to unload the run-down place, which, admittedly, needed a lot of work.</p> <p>I wanted to restore The Palm Inn to its original beauty and reopen it as a bed-and-breakfast.</p> <p>We couldn’t agree on anything. So Levi made me a proposal. One he thought I would surely lose. If I could sell out the place by the time he had to leave for training at the end of summer, he would back off and let me run it.</p> <p>But in the weeks that followed, we got more than we bargained for while we were living under the same roof.</p> <p>Levi and I got closer, and before I knew it, my nightly fantasies about the brawny Adonis became a reality. Not to mention, he was so great with my son.</p> <p>We were in over our heads in more ways than one.</p> <p>Because not only was he the last man on Earth I should be falling for because of our deal, but Levi was also my <i>ex’s older brother</i>.</p> <p>And now the inn was the least of my problems.</p>";
