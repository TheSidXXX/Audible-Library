window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A year after the tragic death of his best friend, Carey Walsh copes with feelings of guilt and loneliness by trolling strangers online. His secret little addiction becomes a nightmarish odyssey when he trolls a billionaire inventor of a futuristic VR simulation housed on a faraway tropical island.</p> <p>The game, known as “Luminether Online,” is actually an experiment meant to rewire the brain’s empathy centers - an experiment that kills the bullies it attempts to fix. Suddenly trapped inside, Carey encounters an epic fantasy world full of vibrant magic spells, terrifying monsters, and ancient gods who left behind superpowered races of humans – one of which Carey must choose as his avatar. Armed with the most basic armor and sword, he must level up, stop a guild of necromancers hellbent on world domination, and do it all while playing as an orange-eyed \"Feral\" rogue with a furry tail and amazing stealth, agility and parkour skills. But there are other, more toxic, players who will do anything to win, even if it means committing real-life murder against their competitors. In order to win the game, Carey must recruit allies, explore the mythical world of Astros, and unlock the secrets of this baffling new reality - because the truth is not what it seems.</p> <p><i>Luminether Online</i> is a standalone LitRPG novel, though it is set in the same world as a different series known as The Luminether Series, a non-LitRPG epic fantasy.</p>";
