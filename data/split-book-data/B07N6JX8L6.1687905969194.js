They hope that's what Mirae is.&nbsp;</p> <p>For mortals, entering the underworld is no easy task. There's no respawn within Hades and resurrection spells now have a lengthy cool-down. Justine's party will face monsters, ghosts, and even deities in their journey. To make matters worse, Hades doesn't release souls easily, and getting back may be just as testing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Justine needs to forge a rock-solid adventure party to find the gates of the underworld, locate Mirae, and bring her home to safety, because if she doesn't Mirae could be lost to both the real and digital worlds forever.</p>";
