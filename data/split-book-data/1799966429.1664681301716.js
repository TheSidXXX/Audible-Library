window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Abigail Carr returns to Bridgewater after long years away at Finishing School, Gabe and Tucker Landry will not be dissuaded from the only woman who’s held their attentions - and affections - for years. They’re done waiting. When Abigail claims she must return to Butte, and to her fiancé, Gabe and Tucker refuse to give up so easily. Since she doesn’t have a wedding band on her finger, nor love in her heart, they consider Abigail free for the taking. And seduce her they do...right home to Bridgewater, where they not only marry her, but claim her body in the most sensual experience of Abigail’s life.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Abigail knows that a future as a wife and mother is not possible, not for her. She only came home to save a friend’s life, and she dare not stay. If she doesn’t return to Butte in the next three days, her best friend will die. And no matter how much Abigail wishes she could stay and be the wife Gabe and Tucker deserve, she must save her friend. The cruel criminal who threatens her friend will not hesitate to kill anyone important to Abigail, including her new husbands.&nbsp;</p> <p>Abigail will make a hard choice and save them all...no matter the cost to herself or her heart.</p>";
