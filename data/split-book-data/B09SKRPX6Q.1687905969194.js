But, if Sam can grind harder, loot more, and gather enough powerful allies, there's a small chance that not only can he stop the war, but unlock a secret no one could expect: Godmode!&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Warning: </b>This audiobook contains dimension hopping, ravishing women, barbarian werebears, amazing magic, raising a pet dragon, and the ability to become the strongest person the universe has ever seen.
