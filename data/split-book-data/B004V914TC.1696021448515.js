window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The best-selling author of the acclaimed </b><b><i>House of Cards</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Last Tycoons</i></b><b> turns his spotlight on to Goldman Sachs and the controversy behind its success. </b></p> <p>From the outside, Goldman Sachs is a perfect company. The Goldman PR machine loudly declares it to be smarter, more ethical, and more profitable than all of its competitors. Behind closed doors, however, the firm constantly straddles the line between conflict of interest and legitimate deal making, wields significant influence over all levels of government, and upholds a culture of power struggles and toxic paranoia.</p> <p>And its clever bet against the mortgage market in 2007 - unknown to its clients - may have made the financial ruin of the Great Recession worse. <i>Money and Power</i> reveals the internal schemes that have guided the bank from its founding through its remarkable windfall during the 2008 financial crisis.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through extensive research and interviews with the inside players, including current CEO Lloyd Blankfein, William Cohan constructs a nuanced, timely portrait of Goldman Sachs, the company that was too big - and too ruthless - to fail.&nbsp;</p>";
