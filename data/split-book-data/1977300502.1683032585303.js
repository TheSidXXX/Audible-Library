But now he's back at square one, stuck on top of a mountain with only the most basic gear to help get him back to Coggeshall. It's going to be a <i>long </i>walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But not a boring one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In one of LitRPG's most legendary medieval fantasy road trips (and also possibly the only one), Montana encounters a pack of just-this-side-of-feral wolf people; a town straight out of the Wild West - complete with heavy-handed sheriff; a lion desperately trying to take down a colossal fish monster; ancient cursed ruins; and a giant flying frog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Eastbound and Town</i> is an epic story full of combat, loot, and achievements. You better believe Montana is loaded up and truckin' and gonna do what they say can't be done.</p>";
