The queen's artifact hunters just don't know what is responsible. Cara is on the trail of an ancient and powerful artifact capable of freezing a city and stirring demons. First she must confront her past and her father's history. Only in learning why her father became a disciple of the Curator can she hope to learn what the old noble seeks and why he is so fascinated by her. </p><p>Then tragedy strikes, and the bond forged by Nefertiti's Heart is severed. Nate without Cara succumbs to his darkness, and he lashes out at those he holds responsible for her loss. Meanwhile, in the shadows, Inspector Fraser waits for his opportunity to pull down the man known as the villainous viscount. </p><p>With London entombed in ice and all hope lost, could this be the end...? </p>";
