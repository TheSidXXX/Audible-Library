window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Malem's back, and he's free of Vorgon and all things demon. It's time to enjoy the fruits of his labor. His newly acquired army is building a city for him and his companions in the forest. He hasn't figured out how he's going to pay his soldiers, but he's confident things will work out. He has a few princesses and queens serving on his personal advisory board, after all, and they have some experience in nation building (among other special talents). He also has a couple of new women who've recently joined his team, and they need to be brought up to speed in more ways than one.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it isn't all fun and games in the Kingdom of Malem. Building a new city in the heart of monster territory is bound to attract some attention, and not the good kind. So, when he faces a large-scale attack from an unknown enemy, it doesn't really come as a surprise.</p> <p>To stave off this latest threat, Malem must once more don his Breaker's hat and return to the fray with his lovely companions.</p> <p><b>Featuring hot women, ugly monsters, a good old-fashioned dungeon crawl, and a massive battle between armies.</b></p>";
