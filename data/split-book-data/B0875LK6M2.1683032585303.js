window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lily Meyersohn’s <i>Exit Interview with My Grandmother</i> is a rumination on young adulthood, through the prism of her relationship with her 92-year-old grandmother.&nbsp;</p> <p>At once profoundly personal and far-reaching, <i>Exit Interview with My Grandmother</i> serves as a meditation on the beginning of a young woman’s life and the series of questions that arise from examining love, loss, family, memory, and death. Moving between cities and centuries, Meyersohn probes her family's Jewish history and her grandparents' relationships in part to decipher her own young queer relationships, but also to examine how we ought to behave in the face of a world riddled with uncertainty and doubt.&nbsp;</p> <p>Comprising a personal narrative and an intimate, recorded conversation with her grandmother, Meyersohn’s essay confronts what it means for something to begin, what it means for something to end, and what we should hold onto along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
