window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dear Listener, </p> <p>There is no way to write a blurb for this final book without spoiling all of the others. Suffice it to say, mysteries resolve, dragons war, pigeons abound, and Julius must risk himself in ways he never dreamed possible as Bob's grand plan finally comes to fruition. </p> <p>But the Great Seer of the Heartstrikers isn't the only one whose schemes are nearing completion. The Nameless End is coming, and even the machinations of the world's most brilliant dragon seer might not be enough to stop it. As the world comes crashing down, it's up Julius to prove what he's always known: that seers can be wrong, and Nice Dragons don't always finish last. </p>";
