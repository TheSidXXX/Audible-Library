His friend, the governor, is just cranking up a presidential campaign, though, and he invites Lucas to come along as part of his campaign staff. \"Should be fun!\" he says, and it kind of is - until they find they have a shadow: an armed man intent on killing the governor...and anyone who gets in the way. </p>";
