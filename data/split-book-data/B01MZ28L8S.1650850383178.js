window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A hilarious, fast-paced space adventure from the author the Independent calls \"the new Terry Pratchett\". </b></p> <p>Cal Carver is having a bad day. Imprisoned and forced to share a cell with a cannibalistic serial killer, Cal thinks things can't possibly get any worse. </p> <p>He is wrong. </p> <p>It's not until two-thirds of the human race is wiped out and Cal is abducted by aliens that his day <i>really</i> starts to go downhill. </p> <p>Whisked across the galaxy, Cal is thrown into a team of some of the sector's most notorious villains and scumbags. Their mission should be simple enough, but as one screw-up leads to another, they find themselves in a frantic battle to save an entire alien civilization - and its god - from total annihilation. </p>";
