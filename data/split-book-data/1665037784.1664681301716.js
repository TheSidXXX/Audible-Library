I might not have the wolf scent, but I have the hearing. I learn she’s a virgin. I offer her two weeks. Two weeks where I’ll show her a large animal. One she can’t resist. Or at least one who can’t resist her. I’ll prove she doesn’t know everything about four-legged beasts. Especially not the fiercest ones who stalk their prey in the night. Especially not one determined to prey on her. Me.</p>";
