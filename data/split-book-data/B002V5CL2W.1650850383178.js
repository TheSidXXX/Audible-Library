window.bookSummaryJSON = "Meet Peter Brown, a young Manhattan emergency room doctor with an unusual past that is just about to catch up with him. His morning begins with the quick disarming of a would-be mugger, followed by a steamy elevator encounter with a sexy young pharmaceutical rep, topped off by a visit with a new patient - and from there Peter's day is going to get a whole lot worse and a whole lot weirder. <p>Because that patient knows Peter from his other life, when he had a different name and a very different job. The only reason he's a doctor now is thanks to the Witness Protection Program-and even they can't protect him from the long reach of the New Jersey mob. Now he's got to do whatever it takes to keep his patient alive so he can buy some time...and beat the reaper.</p> <p><i>Beat the Reaper</i> is not just the only work that will be compared to Quentin Tarantino's films, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, and Chuck Palahniuk - it's also the most original and entertaining debut thriller you'll listen to this year.</p>";
