Both of us. Me and Donovan. It might not be normal for two guys to claim a woman together, but we live in Cutthroat, Montana, and we’ll do what we want.&nbsp;</p> <p>And what we want to&nbsp;<i>do</i>&nbsp;is Kit. What could get in the way?&nbsp;</p> <p>Oh yeah, a little thing called murder. And since I’m the lead detective and Donovan’s the prosecutor, it might not be the smartest thing to bed the prime suspect.&nbsp;</p> <p>As if that would stop us!</p>";
