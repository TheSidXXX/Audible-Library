The Breaker fights for Vorgon now.</p> <p>But that doesn’t mean Malem is going to let anyone harm the five women he’s bound to. They give him the power to control monsters, after all. Besides, they’re super hot.</p> <p>Vorgon doesn’t like the devotion Malem shows his women, so the evil demon decides to send him on a fool’s errand - his mission is to infiltrate the kingdom of the Tree Elves and Break their queen. No easy task, given that she is surrounded by an army of bloodthirsty fighters and merciless mages, not to mention a crapload of monsters.</p> <p>This errand might just backfire on Vorgon, however, because if Malem succeeds, he will grow in power far beyond anything the demon ever dreamed of....</p>";
