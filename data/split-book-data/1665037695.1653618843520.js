window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Pack Rule Number Four: Guard your pups with your life.</b></p> <p>We hooked up one night at Cody’s Saloon. The beautiful nurse wanted a ride, and I’d given it to her. Made her scream and sent her home happy. She didn’t tell me there’d been consequences. She’d kept her secret close. For months. But what she didn’t know could change everything. That baby she carried wasn’t human. And this wolf would never walk away from his pup. She may not have wanted me in her life, but that was too bad. I was moving in - watching over her and providing for my family. She was under my protection now. Whether she wanted it or not. Whether she wanted <i>me</i> or not.</p>";
