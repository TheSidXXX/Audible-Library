window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the not-so-distant future, a deadly plague has forced billions into their homes, and locked them up tight. Hope may soon arrive in the form of an effective new cure from the mega-global Chum Corporation, but not before they decide their customers are ready for it.</p> <p>That’s why they’ve created New Arcadia—a real-as-life virtual-reality game designed to bring the isolated people of the world together again.</p> <p>After its successful launch in <i>New Arcadia: Stage One</i>, the game is being updated and expanded with a new rhythm-game mechanic to bring players together on the dance floor. No longer just for 1990s arcade fighting-game fans, all ages are being welcomed to the virtual party now.</p> <p>For Prime Beta Tester John Chambers and his friends in New Arcadia, the stakes have never been higher. As the original players of the game, they feel a duty to ensure the new arrivals in New Arcadia adapt successfully to the world and prove to the Chum Corporation that people are ready to come together again in real life.</p> <p>But there are other players within the game who have a more sinister objective—and they’ll do anything to ensure that the online experiment of New Arcadia is doomed to disaster and the people of the world continue to languish in solitude for a long, long time.</p> <p>To succeed, John and his friends will have to conquer the mean streets of New Arcadia. And kill it on the dance floor.</p> <p>Starring:</p> <ul> <li>Eric Jason Martin (<i>Heads Will Roll</i>)</li> <li>Matthew Mercer (<i>The Legend of Vox Machina</i>)</li> <li>Erika Ishii (<i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>)</li> <li>Sam Riegel (<i>The Legend of Vox Machina</i>)</li> <li>Dave Fennoy (<i>The Walking Dead</i>)</li> <li>Marin Ireland (<i>The Umbrella Academy</i>)</li> <li>January LaVoy (<i>Law and Order</i>)</li> <li>James Urbaniak (<i>Venture Brothers</i>)</li> <li>Emily Lynne (<i>Heads Will Roll</i>)</li> </ul> <p>Also starring:</p> <ul> <li>Ray Porter (<i>Zack Snyder's Justice League</i>)</li> <li>Emily Woo Zeller (<i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>)</li> <li>Jon Gabrus (<i>101 Places to Party Before You Die</i>)</li> <li>Dana Snyder (<i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</i>)</li> <li>Connor Ratliff (<i>Dead Eyes</i>)</li> <li>and Jeff Gerstmann (<i>The Jeff Gerstmann Show</i>)</li> </ul> <p>With Scott Brick, Suzanne Elise Freeman, P.J.
