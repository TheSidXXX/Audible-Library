window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Reads like a crazed cross between </b><b><i>Watership Down</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i></b><b>.\" (</b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>A new stand-alone novel from the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Early Riser </i></b><b>and the Thursday Next series.</b></p> <p>England, 2022. There are 1.2 million human-size rabbits living in the UK. They wear clothes and can walk, talk, and drive cars, the result of an inexplicable Spontaneous Anthropomorphizing Event 55 years earlier.&nbsp;</p> <p>A family of rabbits is about to move into Much Hemlock, a cozy little village in Middle England where life revolves around summer fetes, jam making, gossipy corner stores, and the oh-so-important Spick &amp; Span awards for the best-kept village.&nbsp;</p> <p>No sooner have the rabbits arrived than the villagers decide they must depart, citing their propensity to burrow and breed and their shameless levels of veganism.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Mrs. Constance Rabbit is made of sterner stuff, and she and her family decide they are to stay. Unusually, their neighbors - longtime resident Peter Knox and his daughter, Pippa - decide to stand with them...and soon discover that you can be a friend to rabbits or to humans, but not both. With a blossoming romance, acute cultural differences, enforced rehoming to a MegaWarren in Wales, and the full power of the ruling United Kingdom Anti-Rabbit Party against them, Peter and Pippa are about to question everything they had ever thought about their friends, their nation, and their species.&nbsp;</p> <p>An inimitable blend of satire, fantasy, and thriller, <i>The Constant Rabbit</i> is the latest dazzlingly original foray into Jasper Fforde's ever-astonishing creative genius.&nbsp;</p>";
