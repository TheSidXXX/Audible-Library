window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He’s no angel, but he’s got everything she needs.</p> <p>He was minding his own business on Earth when a beautiful sorceress summoned him to defend a backwater village from demonic raiders. He’s lost his gun, his family, and even his name, but it’s not the first fight he’s been in, and it won’t be the last.</p> <p>The sorceress isn’t happy - she expected an ancient goddess of war. Instead, she got some random guy who’s halfway decent with a sword. But there’s more to him than good looks and a big stick, and if he can harness this new world’s magic, the town of Foulwater might just be glad he stuck around.</p> <p>First, though, he’ll have to get a busty elf buccaneer to sober up, sail through monster-infested waters, kick a bunch of lava monsters in the face, and plunder the submerged basement of a demon king. It’s a race against time before the raiders return to burn down the village, and their deadliest enemy might already be inside the walls.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer: </b><i>Raider Annihilation</i> is a steamy isekai&nbsp;harem adventure like no other. Our hero isn't shy and neither are the women of Caranja. There is sex, swearing, smoking, drug use, and goat-milk beer. Enter a spicy new world from Aaron Crash, the best-selling author of the American Dragon series and The Princesses of the Ironbound.</p>";
