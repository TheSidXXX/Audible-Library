window.bookSummaryJSON = "David Smick keeps a low profile, but experts consider him one of the most insightful financial market strategists in the world. For more than two decades, he has conferred with central bankers and advised top Wall Street executives and investors.<p><i>The World Is Curved</i> picks up where Thomas Friedman's <i>The World Is Flat</i> left off, taking listeners on an insider's tour through the private offices of central bankers, finance ministers, even prime ministers. </p><p>Smick reveals how today's risky environment came to be - and why the mortgage mess is a symptom of potentially far more devastating trouble. He wrestles with the two questions on everyone's mind: How bad could things really get in today's volatile economy? And what can we do about it?</p><p><i>The World Is Curved</i> is that rare work that speaks simultaneously to the Wall Street, Washington, and London elites, yet its apt storytelling shows Main Street readers how to survive in these turbulent times.</p>";
