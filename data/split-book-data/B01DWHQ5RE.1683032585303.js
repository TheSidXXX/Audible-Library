window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Lincoln Rhyme series, a short story about Lincoln Rhyme solving a mysterious plane crash with no forensic evidence.</b> </p> <p>A small jet with only one pilot onboard crashes into the Atlantic Ocean. Local authorities are unsure whether the cause of the crash is a bomb or a violent storm. The case seems like it will be an easy one to solve for former NYPD homicide detective Lincoln Rhyme to solve. The evidence is inside the cockpit, but there is one problem. The wreckage sits at the bottom of the Puerto Rican Trench, the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean, that stretches to 28,000 feet. The plane can't be raised. And there's no way to get to where the evidence lies. </p> <p>\"Where the Evidence Lies\" by Jeffery Deaver is one of 20 short stories within Mulholland Books' Strand Originals series, featuring thrilling stories by the biggest names in mystery from the <i>Strand Magazine</i> archives. View the full series list at mulhollandbooks.com and listen to them all! </p>";
