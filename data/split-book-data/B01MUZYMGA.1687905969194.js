window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Prince of Park Avenue finally meets his match in a feisty Manhattan Princess.</p> <p>I've made every one of my billions of dollars myself - I'm calculating, astute, and the best at what I do. It takes drive and dedication to build what I have. And it leaves no time for love or girlfriends or relationships. But don't get me wrong, I'm not a monk. I understand the attention and focus it takes to seduce a beautiful woman. They're the same skills I use to close business deals. But one night is where it begins and ends. I'm not the guy who sends flowers. I'm not the guy who calls the next day.</p> <p>Or so I thought before an impatient, smart-talking, beyond beautiful heiress bursts into my world.</p> <p>When Grace Astor rolls her eyes at me - I want to hold her against me and show her what she's been missing.</p> <p>When she makes a joke at my expense - I want to silence her sassy mouth with my tongue.</p> <p>And when she leaves straight after we f--k with barely a goodbye - it makes me want to pin her down and remind her of the three orgasms she just had.</p> <p>She might be a princess but I'm going to show her who rules in this Park Avenue bedroom.</p> <p>A sexy, standalone, contemporary romance.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Harper and Max's story, listen to <i>King of Wall Street.</i></p> <p>For Scarlett and Ryder's story, listen to <i>The Duke of Manhattan.</i></p> <p>For Violet and Alexander's story, listen to <i>The British Knight.</i></p> <p>For Darcy and Logan's story, listen to <i>The Earl of London.</i>&nbsp;</p>";
