window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Esther, a painter living in Jamaica and recovering from the death of her husband, comes across a man on a mountain road with no memory of his past. As a hurricane rushes towards the island, she shelters the handsome stranger, names him “Monty”, and tries to uncover the mystery of his missing memory. She soon finds herself falling in love with a man she barely knows, and who doesn’t even know himself.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Mountain and the Sea</i> is a romantic tale about letting go of the past and embracing the present. Set on the lush Jamaican coast, the poetic prose brings to life the warmth of the sands, the spice in the foods, and the passion of a Caribbean love affair. This is a story for listeners who long for an escape to a faraway place, and for a journey inside the secrets of the human heart. It’s a story that explores the question: How can we leave the pain of our old relationships behind and give ourselves a new chance at love?&nbsp;</p> <p>Kwame Dawes’ poetic prose is brought to life by the enticing and lyrical performance of Jamaican narrator Paula-Anne Jones.</p>";
