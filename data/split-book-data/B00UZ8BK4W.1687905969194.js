window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When <i>Freakonomics </i>was initially published, the authors started a blog - and they've kept it up. The writing is more casual, more personal, even more outlandish than in their books. Now, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the landmark <i>Freakonomics</i>, comes this curated collection from the most readable economics blog in the world. </p> <p><i>Why don't flight attendants get tipped? If you were a terrorist, how would you attack? And why does KFC always run out of fried chicken?</i> </p> <p>Over the past decade, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have published more than 8,000 blog posts on Freakonomics.com. Now the very best of this writing has been carefully curated into one volume, the perfect solution for the millions of listeners who love all things Freakonomics. </p> <p>Discover why taller people tend to make more money; why it's so hard to predict the Kentucky Derby winner; and why it might be time for a sex tax (if not a fat tax). You'll also learn a great deal about Levitt and Dubner's own quirks and passions. Surprising and erudite, eloquent and witty, <i>When to Rob a Bank</i> demonstrates the brilliance that has made their books an international sensation. </p>";
