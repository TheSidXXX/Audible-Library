You’ll thank me later.” - David Baldacci</p> <p><b>The first in the international bestselling series!</b></p> <p><b>Who is </b><b><i>Orphan X?</i></b></p> <p>The Nowhere Man is a legendary figure spoken about only in whispers. It’s said that when he’s reached by the truly desperate and deserving, the Nowhere Man can and will do anything to protect and save them. But he’s not merely a legend.</p> <p><b>“Excellent...A smart, stylish, state-of-the-art thriller...might give Lee Child’s Jack Reacher books a run for their money.” - </b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b></p> <p>Evan Smoak is a man with skills, resources, and a personal mission to help those with nowhere else to turn. He’s also a man with a dangerous past. Chosen as a child, he was raised and trained as an Orphan, an off-the-books black box program designed to create the perfect deniable intelligence asset: An assassin. Evan was Orphan X - until he broke with the program and used everything he learned to disappear. But now someone is on his tail. Someone with similar skills and training who will exploit Evan’s secret new identity as the Nowhere Man to eliminate him.</p> <p><b>“Hurwitz melds nonstop action and high-tech gadgetry...in this excellent series opener.” - </b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b> (starred review</b>)</p>";
