Now that mentor, John Jack Thompson, is dead, but after his funeral his widow hands Bosch a murder book that Thompson took with him when he left the LAPD 20 years before - the unsolved killing of a troubled young man in an alley used for drug deals.</p> <p>Bosch brings the murder book to Ren√©e Ballard and asks her to help him find what about the case lit Thompson's fire all those years ago. As she begins her inquiries - while still working her own cases on the midnight shift - Ballad finds aspects of the initial investigation that just don't add up.&nbsp;</p> <p>The bond between Bosch and Ballard tightens as they become a formidable investigation team. And they soon arrive at a disturbing question: Did Thompson steal the murder book to work the case in retirement, or to make sure it never got solved?&nbsp;</p> <p>Written with the intense pacing and masterful suspense that have made Michael Connelly \"the hard-boiled fiction master of our time\" (NPR), <i>The Night Fire</i> continues the unofficial partnership of two fierce detectives determined not to let the fire burn out.&nbsp;</p>";
