window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Being the Chosen One is supposed to be awesome, right?</b> <br> </p> <p>Well, that's what most people assume. Most of them haven't tried it yet. <br> </p> <p>Devon Walker really just wanted to power level and collect some loot along the way. But yeah. Things in Relic Online just haven't turned out like she'd hoped. <br> </p> <p>Recently, she completed an epic quest line to reawaken ancient magic, but so far it's been anti-climactic. That would be sucky enough, but unless she figures something out, the game world - including her NPC friends who she believes are just alive as her human guildmates - is pretty much going to die in fire. <br> </p> <p>Fortunately, being the Chosen One means she's still gotta fix things. <br> </p> <p>So yeah, no pressure. <br> </p> <p>The epic Stonehaven League saga continues with <i>Throne of the Ancients</i>. <b>Buy now to listen!</b></p>";
