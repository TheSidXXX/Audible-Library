window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Doug Lee is undead quite by accident... attacked by a desperate vampire, he finds himself cursed with being fat and 15 forever. When he has no luck finding some goth chick with a vampire fetish, he resorts to sucking the blood of cows under cover of the night. But it's just not the same. </p> <p>Then he meets the new Indian exchange student and falls for her - hard. Yeah, he wants to bite her, but he also wants to prove himself to her. But like the laws of life, love, and high school, the laws of vampire existence are complicated - it's not as easy as studying <i>Dracula</i>. Especially when the star of <i>Vampire Hunters</i> is hot on your trail in an attempt to boost ratings. </p> <p>Searing, hilarious, and always unexpected, <i>Fat Vampire</i> is a satirical tour de force from one of the most original writers of fiction today.</p>";
