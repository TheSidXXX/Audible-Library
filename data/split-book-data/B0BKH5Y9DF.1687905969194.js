window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Please note: This show is for mature audiences only. It contains explicit language, sexual references, and adult themes. Discretion is advised.</i> In 2003, the first ever late-night talk show hosted by a 10-year-old boy premiered live for six minutes, before it was violently pulled from the air and abruptly canceled. Its host, Donnie Dixon, hasn’t been heard from since. <i>Past My Bedtime: An Oral History of the Fastest Failure in Late Night History</i> is journalist Phillip Jackal’s audio documentary following his obsessive quest for the truth about what happened that ill-fated night. Can he finally uncover the truth about Donnie Dixon? Or why the government destroyed all evidence of the broadcast? After chasing this story for almost two decades, it’s finally time for Jackal to tell it. This mockumentary features an all-star cast including David Harbour, Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg, Lennon Parham, D’Arcy Carden, Tim Robinson, Jenny Slate, Nick Kroll, Seth Meyers, Sam Richardson, John Early, Kate Berlant, Bob Balaban, Mae Whitman, Claudia O’Doherty, James Austin Johnson, and John Levenstein. <i>Past My Bedtime: An Oral History of the Fastest Failure in Late Night History</i> drags listeners down a satirical rabbit hole using a mix of less-than-reliable interviews, confessionals, and faux archival footage. The truth is out there, and Phillip doesn’t care how many lives he has to ruin to get the answers he wants.";
