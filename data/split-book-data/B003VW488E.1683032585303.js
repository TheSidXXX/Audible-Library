But the sights aren't what draw him - he sees each museum, each cathedral, and each cafe through the eyes of his daughter's killer.</p> <p><i>The killing is simply marvelous.</i></p> <p>Kanon's daughter, Kimmy, and her boyfriend were murdered while on vacation in Rome. Since then, young couples in Paris, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, and Stockholm have been found dead. Little connects the murders other than a postcard to the local newspaper that precedes each new victim.</p> <p><i>Wish you were here.</i></p> <p>Now, Kanon teams up with the Swedish reporter Dessie Larsson, who has just received a postcard in Stockholm - and they think they know where the next victims will be. With relentless logic and unstoppable action, <i>The Postcard Killers</i> may be James Patterson's most vivid and compelling thriller yet.</p>";
