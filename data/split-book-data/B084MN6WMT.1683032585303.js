window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Margaret Trudeau, former wife of Pierre Trudeau, 15th Prime Minister of Canada, mother of Justin Trudeau, Canada's current Prime Minister, and international mental health advocate, brought her intimate staged performance, <i>Certain Woman of an Age</i>, to the Minetta Lane Theatre, where it was recorded live for Audible Theater. In this \"fearless and vulnerable\" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) one-woman show, Trudeau opens up - with refreshing candor - about her extraordinary life and her encounters with some of the most important icons of our time. It's a gripping portrait of motherhood, marriage, life-altering tragedy, and personal triumph. Co-written with Alix Sobler and directed by Kimberly Senior, <i>Certain Woman of an Age</i> is a funny, honest examination of one of the world’s most fascinating figures.</p>";
