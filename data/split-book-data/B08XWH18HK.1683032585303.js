window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Book 6 in the award-winning and best selling&nbsp;Sentinels of Creation saga sets the stage for next year's series finale.</b></p> <p>Only a few short months have passed since Meghan and Shannon successfully retrieved Kellan from a brutal life in Claudiusâ€™ Rome.&nbsp;The Soulborn struggles with how Order, Chaos, and Creation have all left their mark on Kellan during his time as a gladiator.</p> <p>Neither Kellan nor Shannon is given much time to ponder these changes. Upon their return from Rome, Sentinel and Soulborn are caught up in the first act of the culminating struggle between Creation and Destruction.&nbsp;Merlin once again calls on the Sentinel of Order to keep open the narrow path that protects our world from Perditor. &nbsp;</p> <p>To do this, Kellan and Margaret Karnstein are called to fulfill an angelic prophecy. They must breathe life to stone for the heart of Chaos to become ripe for redemption.&nbsp;While Kellan is far from sure how to complete the prophecy, he knows all roads lead through Aibreann O'Dochartaigh, Lucifer's only mortal love.</p> <p>For her part, Shannon leads both Kellan and her most trusted friends into grave peril as she fulfills a promise made despite opposition by vast powers and principalities.&nbsp;The Soulborn remains undaunted as she confronts both demons of the first fall and a Fae prince of Twilight. As Fate would have it, her actions serve a far greater purpose than even Shannon knows, for if our world is to survive, the Soulborn must find <i>A&nbsp;Scion of Amber Light.</i></p>";
