window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Sam Ryder. I was abducted from Earth and brought to a planet called Tor, a world of dying goddesses and monsters. I was leveled up - five times now - turning me from a slightly overweight gamer into a ripped god responsible for protecting three uber-hot goddesses and a retinue of alien women warriors.</p> <p>At this point in the yarn, we've recovered two of the three goddesses' hearts, but still have one to go. Oh yeah, and we're about to be attacked by the largest demon horde in the history of the universe. All in a day's work.</p> <p>This is the continuation of my story.</p> <p>Disclaimer: This book has monster slaying, cursing, heavy violence, and a group of exotic goddesses and alien women. Mature listeners only.</p>";
